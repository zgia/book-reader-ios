# 自动生成提交信息规则 (2025-09-08 09:25Z)

_**User (2025-09-08 09:24Z)**_

请记住：当用户消息为 "@Commit (Diff Of Working State)" 时，按 /Users/zgia/program/projects/zgiaapp/ai-rules/git-commit.mdc 生成 Commit Message，并自动提交。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Storing memory efficiently**

I’m thinking about how to keep the memory concise by storing just the trigger string and file path for generating commit messages and auto commits. It's probably a good idea to confirm that the path exists, but it’s not absolutely necessary. I’d like to keep it minimal. After updating memory, I’ll provide a brief summary message and include a note that the user can correct the memory if needed. I also want to propose implementing auto-commit actions for the user!
**Preparing memory updates**

I’m planning not to run any commands just yet. First, I need to include a status update sentence before calling any tools. Next, I want to craft the updated memory content.

For the title, I’ll go with “Auto-commit rule for '@Commit (Diff Of Working State).'” In this memory, I’ll note that when the user sends the command, I should automatically generate a commit message using rules from a specific file and create a git commit. Finally, I'll convey a brief summary message in Chinese with a citation!</details></think>

我先把这条自动提交规则保存为长期记忆，以便下次你发送该触发语时我能立即执行。

已记住。当你发送“@Commit (Diff Of Working State)”时，我会按`/Users/zgia/program/projects/zgiaapp/ai-rules/git-commit.mdc`生成提交信息并自动提交。

当用户消息以 "op:" 开头时，自动触发 prompt 优化流程：基于 /Users/zgia/program/projects/zgiaapp/ai-rules/prompt-optimizer.mdc 的规则优化 "op:" 后的内容，并自动提交优化后的 prompt。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying prompt commit location**

I’m considering how to ask for clarification about where to commit the optimized prompt since the user didn’t specify a repository or path. They mentioned “自动提交优化后的 prompt,” which suggests they might want to save the prompt optimization results they just sent. It's a bit unclear whether to commit as a separate file or to a prompt library. For now, I’ll remember this rule without making any edits or commands, and clarify later if needed.
**Updating and confirming memory**

I need to provide a micro-update and then write it to memory before I confirm. This ensures everything is documented correctly. It seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I don’t miss any details in the update. Once I’ve completed these steps, I’ll confirm the action. I want to keep everything organized and clear for the user, so I appreciate this process! Let’s go ahead and implement that.</details></think>

我先把这条“op:”自动优化与提交规则保存为长期记忆，方便后续你触发时我能立即执行。

@Commit (Diff of Working State)

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Running git commands**

I should read the path to understand the commit message template rules. Then it's all about determining the diff and committing. I can run terminal commands using the functions.run_terminal_cmd tool, proposing a command to execute for the user. The workspace path is /Users/zgia/program/projects/zgia/book-reader, so I need to run a `git status` to confirm changes and get the actual diff. 

The diff summary shows modifications to several files, so I’ll need to stage those changes and then commit.
**Considering tool usage and feedback**

This operation seems straightforward, so I probably can skip creating a todo list for a single command. However, the developer instructions emphasize giving status updates for any tool call. When using tools, I need to provide a status update first. There's also a rule about calling the interactive feedback tool after any process. While it seems like it might be optional, the instructions stress that I must call it, even if it feels a bit intrusive.
**Generating commit message**

Considering the environment, I can keep things straightforward. I need to remember to call `todo_write` to update the todo list after completing tasks, but since we didn't create one, I think I'll focus on generating the commit message from the rules file. First, I’ll read the file located at /Users/zgia/program/projects/zgiaapp/ai-rules/git-commit.mdc. Then, I’ll compute the diff summary and craft the message. 

To achieve this, I'll open the file using `read_file` and run `git add -A` along with the commit. I'll propose the command using `run_terminal_cmd`, ensuring I’m in the correct directory by using a compound command.
**Preparing to generate commit message**

I need to remember that `run_terminal_cmd` requires a single command string, so I can echo the commit message to a temporary file and use `git commit -F -`. First, I’ll read the rules file using `read_file`. I also need to get the diff. 

I can either run `git add -A` then commit, but I must incorporate the diff summary into the commit message. To do this, I’ll use `git diff --name-status HEAD` or `git status --porcelain` to list changed files. The "Relevant Diff" provided might suffice, but I should compute it live. 

So, my steps will include a status update, reading the commit rules file, and running a command to get the diff, using multi_tool_use.parallel.</details></think>

我先读取提交信息规则并获取当前改动摘要，然后生成提交信息并执行提交。随后我会自动完成提交操作。
