# 设置阅读页背景色和文字颜色 (2025-09-27 02:35Z)

_**User (2025-09-27 00:44Z)**_

@ReaderSettingsView.swift 设置阅读页的背景色和文字颜色，用户可能想自定义颜色对，然后保存起来，自由选择，如何实现呢？

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing custom color presets**

I need to add functionality in ReaderSettingsView, where users can define and save custom color pairs for text and background. This means I need to create a model and some storage solutions for these presets. There’s a ReadingSettings environment object that probably already holds backgroundHex, textHex, and other settings, so I’m thinking it might include persistent storage via UserDefaults. I’ll check `ReadingSettings.swift` to understand the existing structure better.</details></think>

我先快速查阅阅读设置和颜色工具代码位置，然后并行打开相关文件，确认 `ReadingSettings` 的持久化与颜色解析实现，接着在不破坏现有结构的前提下添加“自定义配色保存/选择/删除”的支持。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing color pair support**

The user has requested to add support for saving custom color pairs (background/text) in the ReaderSettingsView. I need to provide implementation steps, starting with making code changes and following the required process involving status updates before any tool calls. We need to add storage for an array of custom presets, likely using @AppStorage with a JSON string or UserDefaults with a Codable array. I think we should also create a model struct for ColorPairPreset with optional properties like id and name. Lastly, we should provide a UI for saving and managing these presets.
**Adding custom color presets**

In the ReaderSettingsView, I'll create a section titled '自定义配色方案' that includes a TextField for naming and a '保存' button. Below that, I can list saved presets with options for selection and swipe-to-delete. I plan to use @AppStorage to manage the array. To ensure persistence, I need to add a @Published variable for custom color presets within the ReadingSettings class.

While @AppStorage does support storing Data, I think it’s simpler to work with String JSON. I’ll set up a struct called `SavedColorPreset` to include properties like id, name, and color values. Then I'll implement functions in ReadingSettingsProvider to manage loading and saving while updating the presets accordingly. It seems defining `SavedColorPreset` in the Data/Models.swift file makes sense, considering the existing code structure.
**Defining color presets**

I think it’s best to define the `struct ReaderColorPreset` in Reading/ReadingSettings.swift to re-use it across views. I’ll also need to update DefaultsKeys.swift to include a new key for these presets. Modifying ReadingSettings will involve adding a custom presets array and methods for adding or removing entries.

Next, in the ReaderSettingsView UI, I’ll create a section for "我的配色方案" that features a TextField for the preset name—with an option to auto-generate a name based on the date/time. There will also be a list of saved presets allowing for application and swipe-to-delete functionality. I'll ensure to avoid duplicates and limit the number to a maximum of 12. Finally, I will update the computed color properties as needed.
**Updating the Provider**

In the Provider, I need to use @AppStorage to store the custom presets as a JSON string. I’ll implement Codable methods for encoding and decoding these presets. The `decodePresets` function will handle loading the data, syncing with `onAppear`.

I’ll also set up change listeners to update settings when the stored JSON changes and vice versa. To manage presets, I’ll add functions in ReadingSettings for adding and removing them while ensuring uniqueness and limiting the array size. Since ReadingSettings is an environment object, this allows for smoother method calls from the UI. Finally, I have to use the apply_patch tool to implement these changes.
**Implementing changes**

I need to implement several steps, starting by updating Utils/DefaultsKeys.swift to add a new key. Then, I’ll define `struct ReaderColorPreset` in Reading/ReadingSettings.swift and update the provider accordingly.

Next, in Views/ReaderSettingsView.swift, I’ll add a state for `newPresetName` and create a section that lists `settings.customColorPresets`, including actions for saving, applying, and deleting presets. While ensuring that indentation remains consistent at 4 spaces, I'll address localization by using plain Chinese text initially, as adding keys will require updates to the localization files.

After creating a todo list with 3 tasks, I'll mark the first task as in progress and apply changes in parallel while managing sequential gating between the modifications. Finally, I'll update the lints post-edit.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing color pair functionality**

I need to implement functionality for the user to save custom color pairs (background/text), choose from saved presets, and delete them, all integrated with ReadingSettings and ReaderSettingsView. I’ll use @AppStorage and possibly a JSON encoded array for persistence. I’ll create a model type (struct ColorPairPreset) that's identifiable and codable, allowing users to store and manage their color pairs. Naming features would be great, but since alerts don’t support TextFields, I’ll opt for a .sheet instead for naming.
**Refining the color management feature**

I’ll allow for default naming and enable renaming via swipe actions, prompting with a sheet. To keep it simple for time constraints, I can add a "保存当前配色" button that appends the color pair with an autogenerated name based on the date and time. I'll provide a list of saved presets with options to select and delete through swipe actions. Using @AppStorage for JSON storage is a must, and I’ll also extend DefaultsKeys and ReadingSettings to incorporate saved presets and computed colors. Then, I’ll implement functions for adding and removing presets.
**Implementing saved color presets**

I’ll add a struct called SavedColorPreset that's identifiable, codable, and equatable, which includes properties like id, name, backgroundHex, textHex, and createdAt date. In ReadingSettings, I’ll have a @Published array of saved color presets. While adding methods for updating and deleting might not be strictly necessary, they do provide clarity. For ReadingSettingsProvider, I’ll use @AppStorage for storing the presets as a JSON string, ensuring I can encode and decode using JSONDecoder and JSONEncoder. Adding onChange handlers will help synchronize the data effectively.
**Designing ReaderSettingsView**

In the ReaderSettingsView, I’m planning to add a section titled "自定义主题," which will feature a button called "保存当前配色." This button will call reading.addPreset with a generated name and may include some haptic feedback. I’ll also create a list (using LazyVGrid or List) to showcase saved presets, resembling the top "预设配色." Each preset can include a delete option via swipe actions or a trailing button, though using List makes swipe-to-delete easier. I might use Form with ForEach to display saved presets, allowing for row actions.
**Enhancing ReaderSettingsView functionality**

I’ll use ForEach over reading.savedColorPresets to create UI elements for adding swift actions, including a button to remove presets. I'll ensure persistence through DefaultsKeys and introduce localization keys for labels, managing both English and Chinese strings. In terms of interface, I’ll add a section called "我的配色" with a Save button and a TextField for naming. I’ll implement functions in ReadingSettings for adding, applying, and removing color presets. Keeping code style consistent and handling localization will be essential as I proceed with the modifications.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Organizing localization strings**

I'm looking at the zh strings and noticing there's no "apply." I could reuse "btn.save" and "btn.delete" for actions. For deleting, I'll use a swipe action with "btn.delete." "btn.rename" is already present for renaming, and I'll create some new prompt strings for that. I want to keep it simple, providing delete via swipe/click and an alert for confirmation. Also, it seems I need to add new keys to both en and zh files for proper localization. I'll implement this in the ReaderSettingsView as well.
**Implementing custom color features**

I'm adding a VStack under the Custom Colors section with a TextField and a button labeled "保存当前配色." The save action will generate a default name from the hex values if the field is blank, like using "\(reading.backgroundHex)/\(reading.textHex)."

Next, I’ll create a section called "我的配色" that uses ForEach to display saved presets with color previews. Users can tap to apply a preset and swipe to delete, which will trigger a confirmation alert. I'll also include a context menu for renaming, considering implementation using .alert with TextField, which is supported from iOS 15.
**Adding a rename function**

I’m planning to implement a rename feature for the savedPresets entries by matching their IDs. Although I could mutate savedPresets directly from the view by finding the index and updating the name, it’s generally better practice to add a dedicated function in ReadingSettings. The developer guidelines suggest using functions for such tasks, so I'll add renamePreset(id:newName:) in ReadingSettings. Even though I just edited that file, I think a small addition for this method is fine!
**Planning modifications**

I’m looking to modify ReadingSettings.swift by adding a function to rename presets. The function will find the preset by ID and update its name. Next up, I need to update ReaderSettingsView.swift with several @State variables for handling new preset names, delete confirmations, and renaming actions. I'll add UI sections for saving presets and listing saved ones, including swipe actions for Delete and Rename. I also need to ensure localized string keys are updated for both zh-Hans and en. Time to implement all of this!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring Alert and Localization**

I'm looking into SwiftUI's Alert feature, noting that it doesn’t support TextField until iOS 17. For now, I think we should use a sheet with a form or a separate confirmation dialog. There are existing alerts with TextField in the project's other views, so inspecting ReaderSettingsView may help identify patterns.

I’ll implement a sheet with @State showSavePresetSheet that includes a TextField for the name and a Save button. We also need to add localization keys for zh-Hans and en, specifically for color preset settings. I’ll ensure that all relevant keys are appended to both files.
**Implementing ReaderSettingsView Modifications**

I want to make sure that ReaderSettingsView uses the right environment reading settings. Adding Section UI is the next step. I'll track my tasks using todo_write, and since we already have 'todo-update-ui' in progress, I’ll perform an apply_patch on ReaderSettingsView.swift for the new sections and state properties.

First, I'll open the file to make specific modifications. I should check the content before editing, ensuring there are no indentation changes. I'll integrate a context menu for each preset row with options for applying, renaming, and deleting while implementing the rename flow with a TextField sheet and a confirmation alert for deletion. I'll proceed with the patches!
**Adding Localization Keys and Commit Messages**

I need to add localization keys to the en.lproj Localizable.strings, ensuring we have the English equivalents. I remember we had issues before with reading, but apply_patch should allow me to append keys while respecting the string file format. 

Regarding commit messages, I need to follow the workspace rules, which mention generating a Chinese commit message when prompted, but since the user didn't send ‘@Commit’, I won’t auto-commit or generate a message right now. I’ll stick to the rules and act only in a commit scenario.
**Considering Commit Messages and Next Steps**

The rules indicate that I should always follow workspace-level guidelines, which might mean generating a commit message for changes. Even though we haven’t committed yet, it could be helpful to provide a suggestion for a commit message. The directive says to keep working until the query is resolved, and since the rules specify to respond in simplified Chinese, including a suggested commit message at the end seems reasonable. I’ll also finish UI edits, run lints, and update the zh/en strings as needed.
**Confirming Localization Files for Patching**

I need to start by reading the two localization files to confirm their content. We've encountered timeouts before, but I think we can proceed with apply_patch without needing to read if necessary. However, applying patches does require some context lines. I can add new keys after the last existing line, but I also need to ensure I have context from the end of the file.

The zh-Hans file ends at L199 with "txt_book_importer.missing_title," so I'll re-open both files to check the tail again while trying to avoid previous timeout issues.</details></think>

我将读取 `ReaderSettingsView.swift` 当前内容，并并行打开中英文本地化文件以便添加新文案，然后在设置视图中实现“保存当前配色/我的配色”列表与重命名、删除、应用的 UI。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Continuing implementation steps**

I need to keep implementing features. Previously, there were timeouts while trying to read localization files, although I did manage to load the zh-Hans content before. I successfully printed the content from the zh-Hans.lproj Localizable.strings file earlier. Now, I’ll move forward with editing the ReaderSettingsView to include UI for saving, listing, applying, renaming, and deleting custom color presets. I also need to add new localization keys for the custom color presets in both the zh-Hans and English files.
**Modifying localization keys**

I need to adjust both zh-Hans and English localizations to add new keys, like "我的配色" for custom presets and prompts for saving, renaming, and deleting presets. I might also want to utilize existing action buttons to avoid creating too many new strings. Additionally, I'll incorporate confirmation dialogs for renaming and deleting actions. For the ReaderSettingsView, I'll add a section for inputting a preset name with a button for saving, but I need to think about whether the input should be persistent or if it’s better as a prompt.
**Implementing UI changes**

In iOS 17, I see that SwiftUI offers a new .alert feature that includes a TextField. I can either use this or opt for a .sheet or .confirmationDialog instead. The simpler route might be to default to an auto-generated name like "自定义配色" or "配色 1" for users, allowing for renaming later. I’ll implement a Button for "保存当前配色" that triggers the prompt for naming. The UI should remain minimal but functional, featuring a section header "我的配色" and displaying saved presets with a color preview.
**Adding swipe actions and updates**

I need to implement trailing swipe actions for Apply, Rename, and Delete in SwiftUI, which I can use starting from iOS 15. For renaming, I can provide a sheet or alert for entering a new name. Tapping the row will apply the preset. I must ensure I import Color(hex:) and be mindful of existing indentation, which uses four spaces.

I'll also check that localization keys exist. Reusing btn.* for button labels is a good idea, and I’ll make updates for zh-Hans and English. I’ll integrate new sections in ReaderSettingsView.swift, adding necessary @State variables for handling the save and rename functionalities.
**Implementing delete confirmation and UI updates**

I need to add a confirmation dialog for deleting a preset using @State for presetToDelete and handling showConfirmationDelete. For swipe actions, I can integrate a Delete function that calls reading.deletePreset directly. I'll create sheets for save and rename actions, generating an auto-name when necessary. Localization keys like "setting.my_color_presets" and others need to be added to zh-Hans and English files. I'll create the new section for saved presets and ensure the code stays consistent with SwiftUI. Finally, I’ll apply patches to both ReaderSettingsView.swift and the localization files, despite earlier timeouts.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring SwiftUI alerts**

I’m thinking about how iOS 16+ supports .alert with TextField. Actually, SwiftUI didn't have a built-in TextField inside alerts before iOS 17, so I'm curious if that’s the case for iOS 17. For now, we can use .confirmationDialog for options or a .sheet with a small form for renaming. It seems safer to implement a .sheet for renaming. I also want to include a section for "save current palette" with a TextField and button — that would be easier.
**Implementing UI States**

I’m setting up some states: a string for the new preset name, an optional variable for renaming a preset, and another string for rename text. 

For the UI, I’ll add a section called "My palettes" and list saved presets using ForEach. Each row will have a sample, name, and actions like "Apply" plus a menu for "Rename" and "Delete." I could opt for swipe actions too, where deleting is destructive and renaming triggers a sheet. 

I'll also include a 'Save current palette' section with a TextField and a Save button, using appropriate string keys for localization.
**Structuring UI Elements**

I want to add a button for "Apply" represented as "btn.apply." I see that we already have "btn.add," but now I'm focusing on ensuring "应用" is included. 

Next, I need several string keys like for renaming palettes, delete confirmation titles, and save options. 

It’ll be good to add a confirmation for deleting presets, using an alert bound to a state variable for the deleted preset. I also need to make sure that saved presets update correctly with @AppStorage. When implementing the save action, I want to ensure the name isn’t empty — maybe disable the button if it is.
**Implementing Rename Functionality**

For renaming, I’m considering using either a .sheet or .alert with a TextField. I think a sheet with a small VStack form would work well. I need to ensure the import statements stay intact. 

In the ReaderSettingsView, we have a private struct for ColorPreset; I’ll keep predefined presets for suggested palettes, which are different from saved ones. I need to add some states at the top of my struct for the new preset name, renaming and deleting presets, and ensure the TextField uses trimmed input. 

I'll also create a section with a TextField for the preset name and a save button that disables if the name is just whitespace.
**Implementing Save and Rename Actions**

I’m setting up the action to save the current preset using `reading.saveCurrentAsPreset(named: newPresetName.trimmed)` and then resetting `newPresetName` to an empty string.

Next, I’ll add a section for the custom palette with a ForEach loop to display saved presets. Each preset will show in an HStack with a sample box, name, and buttons for apply, rename, and delete options. The renaming will use a sheet where I’ll bind the current preset and rename text. 

For confirmation alerts on deletion, I'll set up an alert with a delete and cancel button. I aim to keep the indentation consistent as I implement these changes in ReaderSettingsView.swift and also update localization keys.</details></think>

I’m looking at adding a sheet with an item, $renamingPreset. We'll utilize .sheet(item: $renamingPreset) { preset in ... } for this. It's crucial to ensure that SavedColorPreset conforms to Identifiable and Equatable in ReadingSettings.swift, and I believe we’ve already added both. Also, we need to adjust the view where we used ColorPicker and sections, specifically by inserting the saving section after the custom colors. Now, let's read the file to verify the exact structure.</details></think>

我将读取 `ReaderSettingsView.swift` 的最新内容以定位合适的插入点，然后再进行精确编辑添加“保存当前配色/我的配色”的 UI。

我先在设置视图中加入状态与“保存/我的配色”两个分区，并添加重命名弹窗与删除确认；随后我会补充中英文本地化键。接着我开始修改 `ReaderSettingsView.swift`。

## Todo List

- [x] 为阅读设置添加可编码的自定义配色模型与持久化键
- [x] 在 ReadingSettingsProvider 同步自定义配色数组与 @AppStorage
- [x] 在 ReaderSettingsView 添加保存/选择/删除自定义配色 UI

---

已完成以下更新并通过本地语法检查：
- 在 `ReadingSettings` 增加 `SavedColorPreset` 模型、`savedPresets` 持久化同步、应用/保存/删除/重命名方法。
- 在 `ReaderSettingsView` 新增：
  - “保存当前配色”分区：输入名称后保存当前 `backgroundHex`/`textHex` 到 `savedPresets`。
  - “我的配色”分区：展示已保存配色，支持一键应用、重命名（弹窗）、删除（确认）。
  - 交互状态：`newPresetName`、`renamingPreset`、`renameText`、`deletingPreset`。
- 新增 `DefaultsKeys.readerSavedColorPresets` 存储键；`ReadingSettingsProvider` 与 `@AppStorage` 同步 JSON。

你还需要在本地化里补充以下键值，否则界面会显示占位键名：
- zh-Hans.lproj/Localizable.strings
  - setting.save_current_palette = "保存当前配色";
  - setting.input_palette_name = "输入配色名称";
  - setting.custom_palette_title = "我的配色";
  - setting.custom_palette_empty = "暂无已保存的配色";
  - setting.delete_palette_confirm_title = "删除确认";
  - setting.delete_palette_confirm_message = "确认删除配色“%@”吗？";
  - setting.rename_palette_title = "重命名配色";
  - setting.rename_palette_placeholder = "新的配色名称";
  - btn.apply = "应用";

- en.lproj/Localizable.strings
  - setting.save_current_palette = "Save Current Palette";
  - setting.input_palette_name = "Palette name";
  - setting.custom_palette_title = "My Palettes";
  - setting.custom_palette_empty = "No saved palettes yet";
  - setting.delete_palette_confirm_title = "Confirm Deletion";
  - setting.delete_palette_confirm_message = "Delete palette “%@”?";
  - setting.rename_palette_title = "Rename Palette";
  - setting.rename_palette_placeholder = "New palette name";
  - btn.apply = "Apply";

若需要，我可以直接为两处本地化文件添加这些字符串。
