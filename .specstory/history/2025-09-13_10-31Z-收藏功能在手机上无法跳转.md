# 收藏功能在手机上无法跳转 (2025-09-13 10:31Z)

_**User (2025-09-13 10:31Z)**_

@ReaderView.swift 收藏功能，在模拟器上正常，但是编译到手机上后，可以正常将某个进度加入到收藏，但是从收藏无法跳转到相应为止，点击无反应

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating ScrollView behavior**

I'm noticing that the pages array isn't updating to trigger onChange, even though onAppear has already run. Setting pendingRestorePageIndex won’t lead to a scroll. They seem to suggest using ScrollViewReader's anchor ID for restoration, but since pages aren't changing, there's no event. It could be that the sheet dismissal causes a rerender. Checking the Button actions in the ForEach confirms they set showFavorites to false, which affects visibility, but pages remain unchanged.
**Examining chapter scrolling issues**

The bug appears when the chapter is the same as the current one. The function sets the pendingRestorePageIndex, but it doesn’t trigger scrolling. They could use ScrollViewReader's proxy to scroll, but only within the contentScrollView scope. One approach is to create a `@State` variable for a requested scroll index and use `.onChange` to handle it. Alternatively, a custom notification might be a cleaner way to handle scrolling. In the jump(to:) function, setting both the pendingRestorePageIndex and scrollToTargetId could work to trigger scrolling. I also wonder if changing the `.id(currentChapter.id)` in the ScrollView could trigger `.onAppear`.
**Implementing explicit scrolling**

If the chapter ID is the same, changing `currentChapter` to a dummy value isn't ideal. Instead, I think we need an explicit scroll solution. Since we can't access the `proxy` outside of the closure, I can create a `scrollToRequest` state that the contentScrollView will monitor for scrolling. 

I’ll define `@State private var scrollToIndexRequest: Int? = nil`, and then add an `.onChange` modifier to handle when it’s set. In the jump(to:) function, if we're in the same chapter, I’ll set `scrollToIndexRequest = idx` to ensure scrolling occurs when dismissing the sheet. We can also preserve the existing way of updating progress.
**Refining favorites and scrolling**

I need to also check how favorites are handled. On devices, the sheet might be capturing button taps, but I want to ensure robust scrolling. I’ll have to modify ReaderView.swift and maintain the same style with 4-space indentation. 

I plan to add a state variable: `@State private var scrollToPageRequest: Int? = nil`. Then, in the contentScrollView, I’ll add an `.onChange` modifier to execute scrolling. Since pending restore is already in place, I think I need to ensure thread safety while also computing percentages and saving progress for each page.
**Handling jump scenarios**

After scrolling using the proxy, I think onPageAppear will trigger saving progress. However, I still want to proactively call `saveProgress`. I also need to make sure to close the showFavorites sheet after a click, which is already covered. 

Now, for edge cases, when jumping uses only percent (with nil pageIndex), I should compute the index from the percent and set `scrollToPageRequest`. The code now sets `pendingRestorePageIndex` and `pendingRestorePercent`, but if the index is nil, it doesn't do anything, leading to confusion. So, I’ll implement handling for both scenarios, checking if `fav.pageIndex` exists and computing from `fav.percent` if needed. I’ll need to also check the Data models in Models.swift to confirm the type of `fav.percent`.</details></think>

我会先检查收藏跳转逻辑在同章情况下的滚动触发点，并实现一个在内容已加载时也能立即滚动的机制。接着我会修改 `ReaderView.swift`，在列表点击收藏时触发页面滚动，而不是只设置等待分页变化的状态。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring scroll functionality**

I’m thinking about how favorites should refer to the current chapter, but this might not be working properly. If they’re linked to a different chapter, it should switch accordingly. Maybe the `fetchChapter(by:)` function is returning nil, but it’s using GRDB to read the database, so that should be fine. To enable immediate scrolling when a favorite is clicked in the current chapter, I can use `ScrollViewReader`. I'll set up methods to scroll by publishing a `scrollTarget` binding effectively.
**Implementing page restoration**

I’m considering how to implement scrolling functionality based on the `pendingRestorePageIndex`. We can't use `.onChange` directly in the `ScrollView` content, but we can add it within `ScrollViewReader` where `proxy` is accessible. The plan is to track changes to `pendingRestorePageIndex` and scroll accordingly with some animation.

If the `pendingRestorePercent` changes, we can compute the index there too. It’s important to handle these changes even with API limitations regarding optional values, using a two-argument closure for the `onChange` method.
**Implementing scroll management**

I’m putting together the functionality for immediate scrolling when the same chapter is active, while the existing `.onChange(of: pages)` will take care of different chapters when pages are loaded later. I also want to handle percent changes when it's the same chapter. 

There's a potential issue if `pendingRestorePageIndex` triggers the `onChange` before the pages are updated, but we can check that `!pages.isEmpty`. So, I’ll add new watchers within `ScrollViewReader` right below the existing ones to monitor `pendingRestorePageIndex` and `pendingRestorePercent`, while being mindful of closure signatures in SwiftUI 5.
**Refining change watchers**

I’ve realized that the `.onChange(of:)` closure in iOS 17 uses a new syntax. There's the variant that allows both old and new values to be captured. The current file's using the two-parameter format for `onChange(of: pages)`, which seems compatible. I’ll implement watchers with `.onChange(of: pendingRestorePageIndex)` to keep things consistent.

These watchers should be placed inside the `ScrollViewReader` where `proxy` is accessible. I must also ensure the `jump(to:)` function utilizes percent if `pageIndex` is nil. Now, it's time to make those code edits and apply the necessary patches!
**Preparing for code edits**

I need to manage a to-do list before making any edits, but since this is a small fix, it's not strictly necessary. However, I must remember to emit a status update before any tool calls, as per the developer guidelines. I recall my earlier message had an update before calling the tool, but I should ensure it complies fully moving forward. 

Now, I'll proceed to apply the patch, adding the watchers in the correct spot within the `ScrollViewReader` chain while maintaining indentation. After that, I'll run the linter tool for the file to ensure everything's in order, and possibly propose tests on the device to verify the changes.</details></think>

我要先在 `ScrollViewReader` 中新增监听 `pendingRestorePageIndex` 和 `pendingRestorePercent` 的逻辑，以便在同章节点击收藏时也能立即滚动到目标页。接着我会检查并修复潜在的编译告警。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating message updates**

I'm realizing our assistant's earlier messages didn't consistently use mini updates. The first response planned actions but missed a status update for read_file (Models.swift). The second message started with "我要先..." but also lacked an explicit micro-update. The guidelines indicate that any tool call should include at least one micro-update. I think we'll need to include status updates in our next turn and might skip todo updates since it's a single change.
**Including status updates**

I'm noticing that the non_compliance indicates I should self-correct by including a status update when using tools. Since we've already used tools in the last message, I need to write an update before proceeding with any further tool calls now. I also want to verify the fix location to ensure it works correctly. Sometimes `pageAnchorId` strings can duplicate across chapters, but as long as they use "page-x," it should be fine. I'll also check if it's safe to call ScrollViewReader proxy inside onChange closures.
**Updating user in Chinese**

I’ve confirmed that proxies are available inside the `ScrollViewReader` closure. The .onChange for pendingRestorePageIndex is set up correctly with the pages array, and we're calling saveProgress after scrolling, which is good! Now I want to update the user with a concise summary in simplified Chinese, perhaps asking them to test it on their device. I plan to note that I've added the pendingRestore onChange to scroll immediately when jumping to favorites within the same chapter. I'll mention that we've run lints with no errors and will include memory usage rules, emphasizing that no code output is necessary.
**Crafting final message**

I need to focus on using simplified Chinese for the message and ensure I format only the relevant sections, not the entire message in code blocks. Here’s my plan:

First, I'll give a status update on what I've done: I've added .onChange watchers to enable scrolling and confirmed the code is lint clean. Next, I'll explain why this was necessary: the scroll wasn't triggered in the same chapter case since we relied on earlier page changes, which is now resolved. 

I'll include verification steps for the user: "在收藏页选一个同章收藏，应该滚到对应页；跨章收藏也正常." I'll also ask for any logs if issues persist and remind them to build to a device. Lastly, I’ll summarize key points concisely.</details></think>

我刚刚在 `ReaderView` 的 `ScrollViewReader` 里补充了对 `pendingRestorePageIndex`/`pendingRestorePercent` 的监听，确保同章节点击收藏时也会立即滚动到对应页；随后检查了静态检查，无报错。

### 变更要点
- 修复原因：原逻辑只在“分页变化”或“首次出现”时根据收藏恢复位置；若在同一章节内跳转收藏，分页未变化，导致不会滚动，真机上体现为“点了无反应”。
- 方案：在 `ScrollViewReader` 里新增两个监听：
  - 当 `pendingRestorePageIndex` 改变且已有 `pages` 时，直接 `proxy.scrollTo(pageAnchorId(idx), anchor: .top)`（带动画），并保存进度。
  - 当 `pendingRestorePercent` 改变且已有 `pages` 时，计算页码后同样立即滚动并保存进度。
- 已验证：无新增编译/静态检查错误。

### 请在真机上回归验证
- 在同一章节内添加收藏后，打开收藏列表并点击该收藏，页面应立刻滚到对应页（不再依赖分页变化）。
- 跨章节的收藏仍会切换章节，待分页完成后自动滚动至目标位置（保持原有逻辑）。
- 若仍无反应，请打开调试开关（`DefaultsKeys.readerDebugLoggingEnabled`），抓取 Xcode 控制台里含“📖 onChange pendingRestore...”的日志给我。

- 我已在 `ReaderView.swift` 中新增对 `pendingRestorePageIndex` 和 `pendingRestorePercent` 的 onChange 监听以触发滚动，并确认未引入新的 Lint 问题。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating favorites logic**

I'm looking at the log that shows "pendingRestore" fired, and we scrolled to page 0. If favorites are supposed to refer to percent instead of page index, there might be a problem with how the initial import handled the page index. This could result in the calculation of "pendingRestorePercent" using the wrong values based on "pagesCount." If our stored percent is 0.0, it might suggest there was an error in our percent calculation when adding a favorite. I need to clarify how the pages count is being managed during "addFavorite."
**Analyzing favorite clicks**

I’m considering that the user logs might be from their current attempt when they clicked a favorite with a percent of 0.0. It's possible that all existing favorites in the database had a 0 percent due to an earlier bug that incorrectly stored that value. On the simulator, it worked fine since the percent or page index was handled differently. On actual devices, the pages count varies due to screen size, which could affect mapping. However, it appears that using the stored page index functions properly across different devices.
**Clarifying page index vs. percent**

I realize that page indices are device-specific, which complicates things. Pages are calculated according to screen size, so if I store a page index from the simulator, it might not match on a different device. We also store percent, and we use that for computing the page index when needed. When jumping, we set both values. If a user clicks on a favorite created on the simulator, the page index won't be meaningful on another device, so we should favor using percent for consistency. However, this means that if we clear the pending values while changing the page index, the percent watcher won't run correctly if the index was created on a different device.
**Examining code behavior**

In my code, it clamps to page bounds using an index (idx). If something goes wrong, it might jump to the wrong place. The log shows that both watchers fired: first for page index and then for percent. This could mean that our code effectively cleared the percent in the first handler, especially since we set both to nil. When the pendingRestorePageIndex changes, we set both it and the pendingRestorePercent to nil, preventing the percent watcher from firing again. Since both are property changes, their trigger order isn't guaranteed, but the logs indicate that both watchers responded, suggesting that both observed state changes.
**Investigating jump functionality**

I've noticed that we clear other pending fields in each handler, which could lead to them turning nil. However, they can still trigger if the initial value changes to non-nil. The sequence of execution appears non-deterministic, as both the pageIndex and percent are computed with the values of 0. It seems when users add favorites on the phone but can't jump, it's unclear why the pageIndex would be 0. 

They may have used the context menu to add favorites, which should correctly store the index, but perhaps the favorites sheet isn’t being dismissed properly. If it's open, actions might not trigger as expected—specifically, the ScrollViewReader might not accurately receive proxy calls while the sheet is still up. 

I need to dig into the DatabaseManager functions to ensure favorites have the correct page index and percent when retrieved.</details></think>

---

我会检查数据库层的收藏读写实现，确认 `pageindex` 和 `percent` 的保存与读取是否正确（尤其是真机构建下 SQLite/GRDB 的列名、NULL、类型转换）。接着我会并行查看阅读设置和进度存储，验证是否有影响跳转的逻辑。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting favorites behavior**

I'm considering whether the gesture overlay is causing interference, but I don't think it's relevant. Since both watchers fired and the index is 0, it should scroll to the top. If the user expects to jump to a specific page but is seeing index 0, we need to verify if saving is correct. It looks like `fetchFavorites` reads from the database, so I need to check if the column names are correct and ensure they are set up properly with the right data types for defaults.
**Analyzing favorites issue**

I'm puzzled about why saved favorites consistently show percent as 0.0 and have a potentially present page index. The logs indicate both watchers are firing and non-nil, computing an index from the percent of 0.0. However, it looks like the first watcher triggered because of a pendingRestorePageIndex being set to 0. In the `jump(to:)` function, they assign `pendingRestorePageIndex` to `fav.pageindex`. If `fav.pageindex` were nil, then the first log wouldn't have activated, meaning the saved favorite indeed has a page index of 0, likely from being added on that page.
**Investigating favorites saving issue**

I'm considering whether they tested clicking a favorite on a later page, but the logs show a page index of 0. This suggests that either the favorite was saved incorrectly or changes in the `pages` array's count are affecting how the index is computed. Both watchers fired with percent as 0.0, leading to an index of 0. The `prepareAddFavorite(from pageIndex: Int)` function computes `draftExcerpt` fine, but I'm wondering if `draftFavoritePageIndex` is always set to 0 on real devices, especially in the SwiftUI context menu.
**Examining favorites capture issue**

It looks like `prepareAddFavorite(from: pageIndex)` is passed within the `contextMenu` builder, but sometimes the wrong index is captured due to identity changes in list items. The page ID is set with `.id(pageAnchorId(idx))`, yet it's not used effectively in the `ForEach` entity's identity, which relies on self for stability. The user's scenario indicates that adding favorites works, showing the page number in their list, but we might need to verify if they see correct page numbers as logs show issues with watchers triggering and scrolling to index 0, suggesting a stored page index of 0 and percent of 0.0.
**Addressing favorites saving issue**

The bug with saving or retrieving favorites persists. I think we need more logging to confirm what the `fav` object contains when clicked. I'll add debug prints in `jump(to:)` and `addFavorite`, along with logging in `fetchFavorites`. We can toggle these logs with a `debugEnabled` switch to avoid clutter. 

I'm also considering that the `pages` array might be empty when certain events occur. If the context menu is affecting `pageIndex`, it could lead to mistakes in the indexing. I’ll implement stronger checks in `jump(to:)` to compute `pageIndex` if necessary and log all these changes. Then, I can ask the user to check the page display for their favorites.
**Improving jump function and logging**

I’m thinking about refining the `jump(to:)` function. Right now, when setting `pendingRestorePageIndex` and `pendingRestorePercent`, we assign both values unnecessarily. To simplify, I can modify it to set `pendingRestorePercent` only if `pageIndex` is nil. 

I’ll also implement some debug logging, including print statements for the favorite's chapter ID, page index, percent, and the count of pages when jumping. In `addFavorite`, I’ll log the page index, percent, chapter ID, and book ID. For `loadFavorites`, I could log the count to keep it manageable. Let’s get this updated!</details></think>

我将先在 `ReaderView.swift` 中添加更详细的调试日志，并调整同章跳转时仅优先使用 `pageindex`（避免重复触发），以便进一步定位真机问题并提升稳定性。随后我会检查语法和 Lint。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating page index handling**

I'm adding functionality to save the pageIndex, and it seems to be working well since fetch favorites returns the correct index. However, I'm observing unnecessary triggers onChange when switching chapters—this shouldn't happen after our update. The user has shared logs showing both actions have a zero index, which means it's calling scrollTo but not performing the scroll. It might be due to the component structure requiring an appropriate id in the view tree, and I’ll need to check if wrapping scrollTo in `withAnimation` helps.
**Analyzing scroll functionality**

I see that we already added the withAnimation feature, so that's covered. I’m wondering if the issue lies in the anchor id not matching, as pageAnchorId returns "page-\(index)." When dismissing the favorites sheet, should we call `jump` before or after setting `showFavorites` to false? In the button action, it seems like `jump` sets pending restore, which should work fine. I suspect the ScrollView not being at the top might be due to a non-zero `dragOffset`, and there’s also an issue with an extra `.id(currentChapter.id)` affecting the scroll view. The logs showing "pendingRestorePageIndex → 0" indicate that the same-chapter logic is working.
**Investigating scroll behavior**

I’m considering whether `proxy.scrollTo` isn’t functioning because the scroll view hasn’t completed its layout yet. Even though I’ve put it in DispatchQueue.main.async, it might still be too early. Device latency can vary, so I might need to use a slight delay like `.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.05`. A better plan could be to call `scrollTo` only after confirming the view has rendered or adding a fallback delay when the index is 0. Using `ScrollViewReader` with a top anchor could also help. Additionally, I’m factoring in if `dragOffset` is affecting the content's positioning. Lastly, since the logs show index and percent as 0, maybe the saved favorite doesn’t have data. The user noted they can add favorites but not jump to them.
**Evaluating favorite handling and scrolling**

I'm considering that favorites created earlier on the simulator might have caused mismatched indices. On the device, it seems the page lengths are computed differently, leading to incorrect mappings. While we display the page count in logs as "pages=\(pages.count)," the provided logs don’t include this count. We should ask the user for more detailed debug logs or add our own. When jumping to the same chapter and index 0, providing feedback with a haptic or overlay could be helpful, but isn’t essential. As a fallback, if `proxy.scrollTo` fails to work, I could consider setting `contentOffset` through introspection, but that's tricky in SwiftUI. Alternatively, I’ll plan to rerun the scrollTo call for index 0 with a small delay.
**Implementing scrolling functionality**

I’m thinking about creating a helper function `scrollToPage` that makes an immediate scrolling attempt and then schedules a backup after a short delay, especially for device performance. The dual index and percent triggers might be trying to scroll twice, which isn't harmful but could be inefficient. 

I’ll implement `scrollToPage(_ idx, proxy:)`, using both `DispatchQueue.main.async` and a delay of 0.1 seconds as a fallback. I’ll track `lastRequestedScrollAnchor` to prevent duplicate triggers. If we're in the same chapter, we should reset other pending scrolls and then call for a scroll. I’ll also consider the `ScrollViewReader` being inside `contentScrollView`, though the side previews might not affect touch absorption. I’ll introduce a state property `@State private var lastScrollRequestId: String?` to help detect anchor existence and plan a minor delay as additional fallback.

Next, I’ll update the actual function code to look like this: `private func scrollToPage(_ idx: Int, using proxy: ScrollViewProxy, animated: Bool = true) {...}` with the existing logic for performing the scroll. Lastly, I’ll make sure to replace all relevant calls with `scrollToPage(idx, using: proxy)` and log the pages count and `currentVisiblePageIndex` at that time. I'll then revise the file accordingly and ensure it adheres to formatting standards. Let's implement this!</details></think>

我将把滚动调用封装为一个带延迟兜底的函数，并在收藏跳转和恢复逻辑中统一使用它，避免真机上布局未完成导致的 scrollTo 无效。随后我会检查静态问题。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Checking file context**

I need to apply a patch, but it looks like the file has changed, and it’s 1138 lines long! To get everything right, I need to read the current file first to understand the context. Once I have that, I can adapt the edits accordingly and reapply them. It feels like a lot, but let's tackle this step by step to ensure I get it right!</details></think>

我将读取当前的 `ReaderView.swift` 最新内容以精确插入统一的滚动封装函数，并用它替换多处直接 `scrollTo` 调用，避免真机布局时序导致的无效滚动。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating a scrollToPage function**

I’m crafting a patch with multiple replace blocks. First, I’ll add a private helper function called scrollToPage near the contentScrollView or just before the section labeled // MARK: - 收藏相关. Its signature will be: private func scrollToPage(_ index: Int, using proxy: ScrollViewProxy, animated: Bool). It will call proxy.scrollTo by the anchor id with an async fallback.

Then, I’ll replace existing scrollTo calls in various places with this new function, ensuring I handle each specific line carefully.
**Implementing scrollToPage function**

I’m planning to add the scrollToPage function after the contentScrollView function and before the bottomControlsView, around line 426. I’ll insert it right after the closing brace of the ScrollViewReader content function, carefully maintaining the 4 spaces indentation used in this file.

I’ve also noticed in the user’s logs that the pageIndex is 0 for both instances, which could be due to a nil page index and percent from the database. It seems like perhaps clicking favorites doesn’t work because scrolling to page 0 isn't effective. Our new helper with a fallback may improve the situation.</details></think>

- 我刚在 `ReaderView.swift` 做了两点改动：1) 统一封装 `scrollToPage(_:using:animated:)`，主线程滚动并加了 50ms 兜底以适配真机布局时序；2) 在多个位置用该方法替换直接 `scrollTo` 调用。
- 你的日志显示索引与百分比都被置为 0，意味着收藏读取值是 0 或跳转到 0 页：这可能是收藏数据本身记录的就是第 1 页（`pageindex=0`），或同章跳转但 `pages` 还未就绪。上述改动会在同章场景与分页完成后都可靠滚动。

请在真机再试：
- 在某章中添加一个非第 1 页的收藏，点开收藏跳转，应滚到对应页。
- 观察是否能看到“📖 onChange pendingRestorePageIndex → scrollTo pageIndex=... ”且不是 0。
- 如仍为 0，请在收藏列表里点开的那条收藏检查 `pageindex` 是否确实为 0（`Repositories.fetchFavorites` 已按表字段读取），若是数据问题，可删除该收藏重试。

我将更新跨章节收藏跳转的逻辑：新增并使用 `pendingRestoreChapterId`，让滚动只在切换到目标章节后才生效，避免在当前章节误触发滚动。接着我会运行静态检查。

我已调整收藏跳转的核心逻辑，解决“从收藏无法跳转”的根因：在同章或跨章情况下，滚动可能在错误章节或布局未就绪时触发，导致真机看起来“没跳过去”。

这次改动
- 新增状态 `pendingRestoreChapterId`：只有当当前章节等于该目标章节时，才应用滚动恢复；否则等待分页完成后再滚动，避免同章/跨章混淆。
- 统一使用 `scrollToPage`（主线程+50ms兜底）代替直接 `scrollTo`，增强真机稳定性。
- 在设置恢复意图时，优先 `pageindex`，仅在没有 `pageindex` 时才使用 `percent`；并设置 `pendingRestoreChapterId` 为目标章节。
- 在成功滚动后，清空 `pendingRestorePageIndex`、`pendingRestorePercent`、`pendingRestoreChapterId`。

如何验证
- 打开收藏列表，点击任意收藏（同章或跨章），应准确跳到对应页。
- 控制台应看到：
  - “🎯 jump ... currentChapterId=...”
  - “📖 onChange pages: ...” 之后，若章节匹配，会出现 “restore via onChange ... → scrollTo pageIndex=...”，且紧接着出现对应页的 “📝 onPageAppear pageIndex=...”。

如果还有问题
- 若“📝 onPageAppear”出现从 1、3、2、7... 逐步靠近 23 的日志，这是 iOS 布局完成时的渐进曝光过程，最终应稳定在 23。如果最终未到 23，请贴出完整的这一段日志我再排查。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing change order in SwiftUI**

I'm considering the order of changes in my SwiftUI code. First, I set `currentChapter`, and then SwiftUI re-evaluates its body, creating a new `ScrollViewReader`. The closure linked to `pendingRestore` might reset triggers. But state variables shouldn't disappear during rebuilds.

Then, I'm a bit concerned that `onChange` for `pendingRestorePageIndex` may not activate again since its value remains static. So, I think I should enhance my logging to understand what's happening better—especially with loading pages and the database state.
**Clarifying chapter switching logic**

The user's log indicates there are 51 pages in the current chapter, but when switching to target 65282, the page count likely changes. The user mentions issues with jumping to the right place, so my next step is to ensure we enforce scrolling when the `ScrollViewReader` appears. 

I notice we already handle `pendingRestore` in `.onAppear`. The condition for `needsInitialRestore` seems important, but I realize the immediate restore doesn't depend on it when there are existing pages. That's a good point to clarify!
**Investigating chapter change issues**

When the chapter changes, pages might initially be empty until they load. The `onAppear` should log this, but if there are no pages at that moment, it will only be handled later by the `onChange` method. I’m thinking that the fallback delay of 50ms might not be enough on real devices; a longer delay could improve stability. 

Plus, I'm considering whether the scroll anchor ID exists when we need it. I'm not convinced that the open List sheet is affecting things, but the favorite percent mapping could be involved. The logs seem inconsistent, showing unexpected page indices. I need to dig deeper!
**Examining scrolling and chapter updates**

So, after applying scroll, it seems the list eventually scrolled to page 23, which is what the `onPageAppear` reported. However, the user mentioned it didn't jump correctly even though the logs show it did. Maybe the visual scroll wasn't accurate despite the new `pending chapter` guard; hopefully, that helps.

In this latest log, there weren't any `onChange pages` entries. I did confirm that the `currentChapter` was changed to the target. The book IDs match, so that seems fine. I wonder if the UI didn't refresh because I modified `currentChapter` inside the NavigationStack of the sheet. Also, the dismissal action could be affecting the jump. The jumping code looks okay, as it sets the chapter and closes the sheet.
**Enhancing chapter change handling**

For my next steps, I plan to add more logging when `currentChapter` changes. I can use `.onChange(of: currentChapter.id)` to log the event and potentially trigger a scroll if a restore is pending and pages are loaded. 

I’ll implement checks to call `scrollToPage` when `pendingRestoreChapterId` matches and the pages aren't empty. I want to make sure we handle cached pages correctly and ensure any changes in the chapter trigger appropriate updates. Finally, I need to ask the user to test and share logs for better insights.</details></think>

我将为跨章节跳转增加一个 `currentChapter.id` 的监听，在章节切换完成且页面已就绪时立即滚动；这能补上极端时序下 `pages` 变化监听未触发的窗口期。随后我会检查静态问题。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating task management changes**

I see the developer wants to manage tasks, though we didn't use todo_write due to a rapid change. The system says it's okay for simpler tasks, but we had multiple steps to address. Now, the user posted logs showing "pending for chapter... skip." I need to inform the user to retest and what logs to expect, noting that a guard to skip will be in place until the chapter matches. We should also ensure proper loading from cache or database when changing the current chapter.
**Considering jump scenarios**

I'm thinking about an edge case where a user jumps to the same chapter but finds the pages empty, which is unlikely. We've already managed changes to pendingRestorePageIndex, requiring that pages are not empty; otherwise, they'll wait for pages to load onChange. I should ask the user to test again and provide logs if it's still unresponsive. I also realize that the ScrollViewReader is within contentScrollView, and when currentChapter.id changes, the scroll view resets, leading to the use of new proxies.
**Updating user instructions**

I believe the current setup likely works, even though there's some subtlety. We've got an onChange listener for pages, so I should keep the user informed by simply noting that we've added this listener and to please test again. We must also include a brief progress note according to the status update spec after making modifications. The expected logs should indicate changes in current chapter ID, and if there are inconsistencies with saved restore percent or page indexing due to pagination changes, it shouldn't be an issue.
**Crafting the response**

I’m thinking of how to respond effectively. First, I’ll provide the micro-update in Chinese, noting that I've added a listener for scrolling after chapter transitions and submitted it. I should ask the user to retest on an actual device and check the logs. I need to clarify what they should expect in those logs. If it doesn't work, I can ask them to share specific log lines. I’ll also summarize the changes, being careful not to expose the full code while keeping the message brief.</details></think>

我刚补上了跨章节跳转的兜底：当切换到目标章节后，监听 `currentChapter.id` 变化并在 `pages` 就绪时立刻滚动到收藏位置；同时保留原有的 `pages`、`pendingRestore*` 监听链路，避免时序窗口期。

请在真机重试一次：
- 点收藏后，预期日志会先出现“pending for chapterId=…, current=…, skip”（这是正常的保护），随后当章节切换完成应看到：
  - “📖 onChange currentChapterId old=… new=… pendingChapter=… …”
  - 接着是“restore via onChange(currentChapterId) … → scrollTo pageIndex=…”，并最终出现对应页的“📝 onPageAppear pageIndex=…”。

如果仍未跳转，请把这几行之后的日志贴上来（尤其是 “onChange currentChapterId …” 和 “restore via onChange(currentChapterId)… ” 是否出现）。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing chapter fetch issue**

I'm considering the issue with updates and whether the `currentChapter.id` has changed to 60960, but it seems like debug logs aren't being captured. Even though debugEnabled is true, it’s only on the iPhone 12 where this issue arises. It could be that `fetchChapter(by:)` returns nil due to a different database path on the device. The logs show a pending restoration for a chapter, suggesting the currentChapter is likely unchanged. I might need to add more logging around chapter switching to clarify this!
**Exploring chapter fetching issues**

I'm reviewing how the system can view reading from an earlier chapter. If `fetchChapter(by:)` returns nil, it won't change `currentChapter` or load content, leaving `pendingRestoreChapterId` as 60960. This means no changes occur and the pending page index will trigger but be skipped if it doesn’t match the current chapter. It's puzzling that `fetchChapter(by:)` would return nil, especially since the favorite points to chapterId 60960. I’m also considering potential type size discrepancies between BIGINT in the database and Int in the model—could that be causing issues?
**Investigating fetch issues with chapters**

I’m realizing that on iOS, an Int is 64-bit, so that should not be a problem. The `fetchOne(db, key: id)` function needs a primary key, but the chapter table schema in the DatabaseManager only defines id as BIGINT without a PRIMARY KEY. Previously, fetching chapters worked with a filter, which makes me wonder if `fetchOne(key:)` can still operate without a primary key. However, since our `fetchChapter(by:)` relies on `fetchOne`, if there’s no primary key metadata on the device, it’s likely returning nil.
**Proposing a fix for fetchChapter**

I’ve figured it out! The issue stems from using a packaged database on the simulator, which has the correct schema, while the device uses a minimal database without a primary key. The logs show that fetching content works with raw filters, which don't rely on the primary key. Therefore, I need to adjust `fetchChapter(by:)` to use a filter instead. 

I’ll implement this change, ensuring it works regardless of primary key constraints. I also plan to add logs for nil scenarios as a helpful extra step.
**Planning database adjustments and updates**

I’m considering adjusting the `ensureDatabaseReady` function to create a primary key, but that could be quite heavy in terms of migration. Instead, I think it’s better to just change the fetch method. I should also include a status update as specified, using minimal verbosity in Chinese and providing a micro status update before tool calls. Since this is a small task, I can skip creating a todo list, but I’ll still add a brief progress note with my changes. I’m ready to apply the patch and then run a quick test before summarizing the root cause and asking to retest!</details></think>

我先修复 `fetchChapter(by:)` 不使用主键获取，改为按 `id` 字段过滤，以避免设备上表未声明主键导致的获取失败。接着我会做一次静态检查。

- 我已将 `fetchChapter(by:)` 改为按 `id` 字段过滤获取，而不是 `fetchOne(db, key:)`。原因：你的建表里 `chapter` 没声明主键，真机上 GRDB 的主键推断可能不同于模拟器，导致跨章节收藏跳转拿不到目标章节，后续只看到“pending for chapterId=..., current=..., skip”，而没有进入章节切换与滚动。
- 现在跨章节点击收藏时，应能正确获取目标章节，`currentChapter` 会切换到收藏的章节，然后触发我们已加的 `currentChapter.id` 与 `pages` 的监听，完成滚动定位。

请在真机重试：
- 打开收藏并点击一条跨章节收藏，看是否出现“📖 onChange currentChapterId ...”与随后的“restore via onChange(currentChapterId) … → scrollTo pageIndex=…”。如果有，最终应到达目标页。
