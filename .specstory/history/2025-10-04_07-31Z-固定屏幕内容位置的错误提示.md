<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing SwiftUI Layout Issues**

I need to make a change in the SwiftUI UI. When there's no password input, we shouldn’t show an error message. If a wrong password is entered, an error banner should appear, but right now, its appearance shifts the screen content up. I want to fix that by reserving space for the banner to prevent layout jumps. I could conditionally show it with opacity or use ZStack for absolute positioning, maintaining consistent banner height. Wrapping the content in a fixed-height container could help too.
**Optimizing Banner View Display**

I’m considering rendering the banner view continuously but controlling its text and style. Another option is to use `.overlay(alignment: ...)` to display the banner without impacting the layout. To proceed, I need to search for `unthFailedAttemptsView()` in `BookReaderApp.swift` and locate the `errorBanner` function. Since this task is relatively small, involving just a couple of edits, I might not need a todo list. I'll also provide status updates before tool calls and read files in parallel where necessary.
**Executing Parallel File Reading**

I plan to read the current file contents while simultaneously grepping for the definition of `errorBanner` across the entire repository. It seems efficient to tackle both tasks at once. Before diving in, I'll provide a quick status update to keep the process transparent and organized. Once that’s done, I’ll make the parallel calls to ensure I get the necessary information promptly. This approach should help streamline things!</details></think>

我先查看 `BookReaderApp.swift` 中与错误提示相关的视图实现，并定位 `errorBanner` 的定义位置以便调整为不影响布局的显示方式。接着我会修改逻辑：输入为空时不显示错误，错误时显示但固定占位避免整体上移。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing error display behavior**

I need to implement behavior adjustments for how the system handles passcode inputs. Specifically, I shouldn't show an error when no passcode is entered, but I should display an error for incorrect entries. Right now, the layout shifts when an error appears due to the addition of an error banner. To fix this, I might need to reserve space with a fixed-height placeholder or overlay the banner, keeping the content's positions fixed, as requested by the user.
**Implementing fixed error display**

The best approach is to allocate a fixed-height space for the error area. I need to animate the error banner's fade in and out while keeping the overall layout height constant. To do this, I'll modify `unthFailedAttemptsView` so it consistently renders a container with a fixed height, possibly using `GeometryReader` to measure the error banner size. Using a hardcoded height like 36 might work, but I can also create an `errorArea` with a height of 44 and adjust its visibility. This will also ensure that errors are only shown when needed, addressing the user's concerns about content movement.
**Implementing code changes**

I need to implement code changes using either the apply_patch or edit_file tool, with a preference for apply_patch. The instructions remind me to re-read the file before applying, but since I've already done this, I can move forward. I'm editing the `unthFailedAttemptsView` function to always reserve space for the error banner. I considered renaming it since "unth" might stand for something, but I'll keep the name the same. The function will reserve a fixed height, even returning an empty view when no error is present.
**Adjusting error banner layout**

The container for the error banner should only include its height without the top padding, which is currently set to 8. To maintain a constant layout, I need to set the container's height to the maximum banner height. One option is to keep `unthFailedAttemptsView` as a container and use a ZStack to manage visibility based on the state, but I need to address that internal padding. It might be better to remove the top padding from the `errorBanner` and manage spacing outside the container to ensure consistent space above.
**Modifying error banner and alignment**

To avoid messing with alignment, I can change the `errorBanner` by removing the external `.padding(.top, 8)` and return a bare capsule. In the VStack, I’ll include a fixed height for the container plus top padding. I’ve confirmed that modifying `errorBanner` will primarily impact this area. 

So, I’ll proceed to set the container height to around 44, ensuring consistent spacing. We want to keep the internal padding, but it may push elements down, which could be okay as long as we manage the relative sizes properly. When no input is provided, it should still show a blank container with reserved height, addressing any content shift the user noticed. 

Additionally, I’ll apply the necessary patch and run lint checks on the modified file, as suggested, while noting that I won’t execute a commit unless prompted by the user.</details></think>

我将把错误提示区域改为固定高度的占位容器，显示与隐藏仅改变不透明度，避免视图因高度变化而上移。接下来我会编辑 `BookReader/BookReaderApp.swift` 中的 `unthFailedAttemptsView()`。

- 我已将错误提示容器改为固定高度，不再因显示/隐藏导致布局上移。现在未输入密码时不显示错误；输入错误后显示错误提示，但整体位置保持不变。

- 关键修改：`unthFailedAttemptsView()` 用一个固定高度的 `ZStack` 包裹提示内容，并仅在需要时渲染提示，外层 `.frame(height: 44)` 保持高度稳定。

- 若需要更贴合视觉，可调整占位高度（目前为 44）或在 `errorBanner` 上微调内边距。
