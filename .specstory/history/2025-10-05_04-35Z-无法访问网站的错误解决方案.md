<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering iOS Local Network Permissions**

I’m noticing that iOS requires specific entries in Info.plist, like `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` and `NSBonjourServices`, for local network discovery starting from iOS 14+. Without these permissions, inbound connections could be blocked. Local Network Privacy also requires user consent for apps to access devices. When advertising Bonjour, the app would prompt for local network permissions. If those entries are absent, Bonjour might not function correctly, so it’s wise to include them for a smooth experience.
**Evaluating iOS Server Connection Limitations**

I’m considering that iOS may not allow background server running, but foreground operation should be okay. I should check for firewall issues, but there shouldn’t be one. Port 8088 should be accessible for inbound connections on the local network. If the server binds to `0.0.0.0`, other devices on the same LAN can connect to it. However, connections over cellular won’t work. I need to ensure the server is configured correctly in the code. Let me suggest some code updates for binding the address.
**Exploring Code Modification Options**

The user has raised an issue, but it doesn’t seem like they’re asking for direct code changes. My directives indicate I should utilize available tools for discoverable info. I’m considering if we should modify the code to bind to the correct interface. I can look into adjusting the `WebUploadServer.swift` file to use the proper FlyingFox initializer but need to ensure it compiles successfully. I’ll search the project for "FlyingFox HTTPServer(...)" to check for patterns. Using grep or codebase_search seems like the best approach!
**Suggesting Fix Steps for Code Setup**

Instead of editing code directly, I could suggest some steps to add specific keys in Info.plist: 
- `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` for local network privacy. 
- `NSBonjourServices` with `_http._tcp.`

It's important to ensure the device and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network and not using `http://127.0.0.1`. The server should bind to all interfaces, so settings for FlyingFox need to be clear. I think I’ll check the project’s Info.plist to confirm existing keys for network privacy and necessary adjustments. Let's read the files!
**Reading Info.plist Files**

I’m planning to read the Info.plist file using functions.read_file, and it might be a good idea to check the localized zh-Hans InfoPlist.strings as well. This way, I can see if the necessary keys for local network usage and Bonjour services are present. It’s important to ensure everything is correct so that the app works seamlessly with the local network. Let's see what we find in those files!</details></think>

我先检查 `Info.plist` 是否已包含本地网络权限与 Bonjour 服务声明，并确认是否需要修改 `HTTPServer` 的绑定地址以允许外部设备访问。随后我会并行读取相关文件。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing connection issues**

I need to resolve the user's connection issue. It’s accessible on the simulator, but the real device shows an "ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE" error. The code uses FlyingFox HTTPServer with default host binding, which typically binds to 127.0.0.1. I should recall that FlyingFox can have a hostname parameter for the HTTPServer. 

If it's only listening on 127.0.0.1, external connections to 192.168.x.x won't succeed since the server won't be reachable from other devices.
**Analyzing simulator connection issues**

In the simulator, sometimes connecting to 127.0.0.1 is possible due to host bridging, but users might be using actual IPs. They mentioned they can connect and upload on the simulator, but the device shows unreachable errors. 

I wonder if iOS 14+ Local Network Privacy permissions are enough. They have appropriate permissions. A common issue appears to be binding to 127.0.0.1, which wouldn’t allow connections from other devices. It would be better to bind to 0.0.0.0 or a specific interface for accessibility. I'll need to check FlyingFox for the correct host binding options.</details></think>

我先确认 FlyingFox 的默认监听地址以及如何绑定到 0.0.0.0，以判断是否需要修改 `HTTPServer` 初始化参数。随后我会检查是否还需要在 `Info.plist` 添加 `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` 之外的键。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing server reachability**

I need to figure out why the web server can’t be reached on the device. They’re using the FlyingFox HTTPServer, appending routes, and trying to get the current WiFi IP by enumerating interfaces. It seems serving might require the HTTPServer to bind to 127.0.0.1 by default, which isn’t reachable remotely. I should check FlyingFox’s API because it allows specifying address and port, and might have options to bind to .ipV4(.any). A web search for "FlyingFox HTTPServer bind 0.0.0.0" might help!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating network issues**

I'm considering how an iPhone on an IPv6-only network might lack an IPv4 address, leading to a fallback server URL that utilizes a port usage string. The server likely supports IPv6, yet we typically display an IPv4 address. I’m thinking if they typed the correct domain, it shouldn't be unreachable. Issues might arise from App Transport Security, NAT64, or if port 8088 falls under restricted ephemeral ports. Firewalls could block peer-to-peer connections, but Bonjour allows Bluetooth/Wi-Fi direct connections. For iOS 17+, Bonjour services must be formatted correctly in the app's Info.plist.
**Clarifying Bonjour services**

I'm thinking about how some services need to be specified with `._tcp.`. Apple's documentation mentions both `_http._tcp` and `_daap._tcp`, and it looks like variations are accepted, though earlier formats included a trailing dot. On iOS 14, if using Bonjour for browsing or resolving, "Bonjour Services" must be included for privacy prompts, but it isn't necessary for starting a listener. I see that the Info.plist includes the NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription key in Chinese, which is good. 

It seems like FlyingFox by default binds to IPv4 on the interface, but I need to check the code for HTTPServer creation, as I'm unsure if an address binding parameter is set.
**Checking library API**

I need to implement code changes to ensure the server listens on 0.0.0.0. First, I'll check the library API to confirm the necessary adjustments. I think it would be helpful to open the `Package.resolved` file to find the version of FlyingFox being used. This will guide me in making the right changes. Let’s take a look at that file and see what information it contains to ensure compatibility.</details></think>

我将并行读取 SwiftPM 的 `Package.resolved` 以查看 FlyingFox 版本信息，并检索是否存在 `HTTPServer` 可配置监听地址的 API。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing connection issues**

I need to diagnose why it works on the simulator but not on the device. It seems they have WebUploadServer on port 8088, but it's possibly only accessible from the localhost, causing the ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE error on the desktop browser. 

Now, regarding iOS 14+, they've included NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription, but it might be worth checking the NSBonjourServices string due to the trailing dot issue. However, for privacy, the sockets may not require NSBonjourServices if they are just serving and not browsing.
**Exploring local network access issues**

On iOS 14, a local network privacy alert appears when the app creates an inbound server. Apple triggers this when the app tries to access local network names or connect with Bonjour. Running a listener might not trigger the alert, but since their server is inbound only, the user accesses it from a desktop. It’s possible that iOS 14 blocks inbound connections until permission is granted, even though many users report issues until the app requests local network usage. Client isolation on Wi-Fi networks may also hinder peer-to-peer access.
**Analyzing connection issues**

The ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE error indicates that the browser can't route to the IP, which could happen if the server is bound only to 127.0.0.1. Normally, if that were the case, connecting to the device IP would still lead to a timeout or connection refused error, but "unreachable" suggests the OS can’t route due to network issues or Wi-Fi isolation blocking access. 

The user computes the current Wi-Fi IP using a scan for "en*" AF_INET, but attempts from the PC are failing. It seems like FlyingFox HTTPServer may need to bind to a broader address. I'll check the documentation for more details!
**Searching code for server initialization**

I want to search the codebase, but I can't easily access remote library code. Instead, I’ll recall from memory that FlyingFox HTTPServer has an initializer like init(port: UInt16 = 8080, bindAddress: String? = nil, reusePort: Bool = false). I'm not entirely sure about that. I think there might also be an HTTPServer(address:) or HTTPServer(configuration:) initializer. 

To clarify things, I should use grep to look for where "HTTPServer(" is used throughout the codebase to find any potential bind address usage.</details></think>

我将搜索项目中 `HTTPServer` 的使用，以确认可配置项，并并行检索 FlyingFox 文档的监听地址配置。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging web service issues**

The user reported that they can access the web service in the simulator but encounter an "ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE" error on their device. I need to debug this and suggest code changes. The WebUploadServer is using FlyingFox's HTTPServer, which might default to binding to loopback. On iOS, binding to INADDR_ANY versus loopback could matter. FlyingFox listens on all interfaces by default, but I need to check if it has the right configurations. I can't access the documentation right now, though.
**Identifying connection issues**

I'm examining why the user encounters an "ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE" error when trying to connect to their phone's IP and port from a desktop. A few typical issues may be at play: They might not be on the same Wi-Fi network, or the IP detection could be wrong, as iPhones use the "en0" interface. They should be able to connect if they type the correct IP, since the code uses Bonjour for discovery. However, a larger issue could be iOS 17+'s "Local Network Privacy," which might block inbound connections.
**Understanding network permission issues**

Since iOS 14, apps must initiate network discovery or send requests to trigger permission prompts for local network access. If they only listen without sending, the prompt may not appear. I think using Bonjour could help with triggering it, but it might not. There are settings that allow app access to the local network, and if not enabled, inbound connections might still be blocked. Apple's documentation states that browsing or resolving can trigger a permission prompt, but inbound listeners alone may not.
**Addressing Bonjour service requirements**

Many developers use a Bonjour browser to generate the necessary permission prompts. One issue could be that iOS requires "Bonjour service types," specifically NSBonjourServices, to list the service types being browsed or advertised. They have "_http._tcp," but it seems the trailing dot isn't always required, although Apple’s documentation suggests it should be included. Without this, browsing and advertising might not work as intended. Even with this setup, the persistent "ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE" error remains when connecting from the desktop.
**Investigating connectivity issues**

It looks like the connection can't route properly because the iPhone and computer might be on different subnets. Issues like network isolation settings or denied "Local Network" permissions on iOS 14+ could block inbound traffic. The user employed Bonjour, but perhaps the setting for allowing peer-to-peer isn't needed here. Another possibility is that the HTTPServer binds to localhost by default, restricting access. Quick thoughts suggest we should set the bindAddress for `HTTPServer` to "0.0.0.0" to ensure it listens on all interfaces. I'll check the code for any existing configurations.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing iOS connection issues**

In iOS, if the app lacks permission, it might block inbound connections due to network privacy. It's essential for the app to have Local Network permission in Settings > Privacy. I wonder if connections are blocked without permission. Also, on iOS 17+, disabling "Wi-Fi Private Address" allows the inbound server to be reachable. If the device and computer are on the same network, some routers may prevent communication through client isolation, which causes errors like ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE.
**Investigating network issues**

Some home routers have "client isolation" enabled by default, especially on guest networks. When connecting an iPhone, it's often on the 5GHz band, which is still part of the same LAN unless it's a guest network. Instructions should include ensuring both devices are on the same SSID and disabling client isolation. Additionally, features like "Low Data Mode" and "Private Relay" may affect connectivity, but Private Relay operates only for external traffic, not local. I also wonder about other potential issues like server binding to IPv6 only or firewall restrictions.
**Exploring FlyingFox modifications**

I’m checking the readme for FlyingFox version 0.25 quickly. I think we can propose adjustments to set up the HTTP server using `listen: .port(8088)` and `bindAddress: .ipv4(0.0.0.0)` if it’s an option. There's also an `HTTPServerConfiguration` with an "address" property I recall; maybe `HTTPServer(using: .init(port:port, address: .inet4(0.0.0.0)))`? I’m a bit uncertain. Another avenue could be `HTTPServer(port: UInt16, bind: String?)`. I might need to search the web for more specifics.</details></think>

我准备进一步查 FlyingFox 0.25.0 的 API，以确认是否存在设置监听地址为 0.0.0.0 的方式，并同时核查常见的“客户端隔离/Guest Wi‑Fi 导致局域网不可达”的说明。随后我会给出具体代码修改建议或操作步骤。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing network issues**

I’m considering the scenario where the code calculates the Wi-Fi IP via getifaddrs. It might be incorrectly picking an interface while the server binds to the default interface. I need to confirm if FlyingFox binds to the any interface by default. 

Now, I'm also thinking about why something isn't reachable. ATS deals with outbound HTTP, so it's not the issue here since the phone isn't performing outbound HTTP. 

Let’s also look at AP isolation settings on routers; if enabled, devices can't connect with each other, which could lead to address unreachable errors. Lastly, could the phone be on cellular or using iCloud Private Relay?
**Exploring connectivity issues**

I’m considering how iOS 17+ uses Private Wi-Fi address randomization, which operates within a local area network. The server is running on port 8088, and iOS typically allows listening on random ports without needing special entitlements. 

However, the computer can’t access the server, possibly because it’s binding to IPv6 only. If the iPhone is on an IPv6 network, the computer using IPv4 wouldn’t route correctly. It appears I need to verify if FlyingFox listens on IPv6 by default, considering NWListener might allow IPv6 and IPv4.
**Identifying connection problems**

I’m thinking about another possible issue: the Wi-Fi network may have "client isolation" enabled, which prevents devices from accessing each other. Many routers have this “AP isolation” feature that could explain the situation. On the emulator, everything works since the server runs on the Mac, and the emulator shares the host.

Alternatively, if the HTTPServer binds only to 127.0.0.1 or loopback, other devices wouldn't be able to connect. I wonder if FlyingFox defaults to "localhost." I should check the documentation for FlyingFox’s binding options and improve my search query for better results.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring server connectivity**

I’m considering the `HTTPServer` from swhitty/FlyingFox, which usually listens on all interfaces at 0.0.0.0. My initial search didn’t yield specific results because the web_search tool provided generic content. It seems NWListener typically binds to .any for TCP connections, suggesting the server should be reachable on the LAN. However, I'm pondering why it might be unreachable.

One potential issue could be related to iOS versions, specifically starting with iOS 14, where local network permissions are required for accessing other devices. There might also be additional requirements for declaring Bonjour service types in Info.plist.
**Considering inbound connection issues**

I’m thinking about how an inbound connection works. If the app doesn't request permission to access the local network, it might not be able to connect. Inbound connections could remain blocked until the app triggers network activity that prompts a permission request. They do include `includesPeerToPeer`, but it’s worth double-checking if `NWListener.service` has been called since Bonjour services are advertised.

Apple’s documentation emphasizes that without user permission, inbound connections may be blocked. So, I need to make sure that the app prompts users for permission upon publishing Bonjour services.
**Diagnosing connection issues**

The user is unable to access via a browser, which makes me wonder if Local Network permissions are disabled on their phone. I should suggest checking Settings > Privacy > Local Network to enable permissions for the app.

Another potential issue could be AP Isolation, where routers prevent client devices from communicating with each other, leading to an "ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE" error. If they’re connected via a mobile hotspot, inbound connections might also be blocked. It’s important to ensure the PC and phone are on the same subnet while checking if the network supports both IPv6 and IPv4.
**Analyzing network code issues**

I'm looking at the code that uses Wi-Fi IPv4 addresses, where it enumerates names starting with "en" to find AF_INET addresses. On the device, the Wi-Fi interface is usually "en0," returning an IPv4 address. However, if the network is IPv6-only, it might return nil for the IPv4 address. 

In the `start()` function, if ip is nil, it sets the serverURL to "http://<port>", but if users are trying to access this displayed URL, it might be inaccurate. The "ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE" error suggests they may be inputting an IP address that doesn't work. Also, there’s a requirement to include `NSBonjourServices` for local network connections.
**Examining connection issues and configurations**

I’m analyzing the use of `_http._tcp` in the Info.plist and whether the missing trailing dot could be an issue. For iOS 17+, the "Local Network Privacy" entitlement is essential for Bonjour service types, while enabling multicast is needed for mDNS. 

The code retrieves the first "en" interface which might cause confusion with multiple interfaces, leading to unreachable addresses, especially if link-local addresses like 169.254.x.x are picked. 

The server may be listening only on IPv6, complicating connections for devices trying to access via IPv4. This whole situation could require updates to the retrieval function and network advertising to ensure connections are possible.
**Refining network address selection**

I'm suggesting improvements to the code to refine the selection of the primary Wi-Fi IPv4 address, specifically favoring "en0" for Wi-Fi on iPhones. I'll avoid link-local addresses like 169.254.* as they can cause issues. The server URL should be correctly displayed if the server is bound to 0.0.0.0. 

I recommend steps for the user to ensure both devices are on the same SSID and check local network permissions. Updates to the code will include prioritizing "en0," providing an IPv6 address, and displaying the Bonjour `.local` URL for easy access.
**Improving IPv4 and IPv6 selection**

I'm focusing on refining how to select global unicast IPv6 addresses while avoiding link-local ones and ensuring we handle IPv4 efficiently. To enhance the server URL assignment, I want to compute the IPv4 address and provide a fallback to a `.local` URL for mDNS.

I'll also include steps for the user to troubleshoot their network environment, especially regarding permissions and ensuring both devices are on the same network. Additionally, I’m considering code changes to prioritize the `en0` interface while skipping link-local addresses, which should help resolve the unreachable issue. I'll create tasks to keep track of these proposed updates.
**Implementing changes and updates**

I'm focusing on implementing the necessary changes, specifically importing `ifaddrs` and ensuring that the code compiles correctly. I'll check for any relevant flags and prepare to replace the function with updated logic. 

After this, I need to create a "todo" item to keep track of my progress. Lastly, I’ll provide quick steps for the user to verify their settings, especially regarding Local Network permissions and isolation. I’ll also prepare a suggested commit message, although I won’t execute the commit since the user didn’t include "@Commit."</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating network access issues**

Apple's documentation indicates user consent is needed for local network access, especially for browsing and connecting to devices. I'm unsure whether listening requires consent too. Apps can host HTTP servers on iOS, accessible via Safari. There might be networking issues like NAT, Wi-Fi isolation, or guest networks causing the unreachable error. I need to check the "Private Wi-Fi Address" settings on the iPhone. Lastly, I'll verify port 8088 access and the server's binding in FlyingFox.
**Proposing connection fixes**

I’m considering using HTTPServer with INADDR_ANY, but since that’s uncertain, I think using NWListener might be a better option. This requires NWParameters.tcp and setting the local endpoint properly. Alternatively, we could create our own custom NWListener, but I prefer to adjust the host parameter if possible. I need to carefully suggest binding to 0.0.0.0 without making blind code changes. For the user’s issue, I’ll lay out some steps to help troubleshoot the connection.
**Addressing service publishing issues**

I’m looking at how using NetService publish can trigger permission since it advertises the service. It seems essential to list NSBonjourServices exactly as "_http._tcp."—I noticed the Info.plist has it without the trailing dot, so I recommend adding that.

Next, ensure that Bonjour services are correctly set and include Peer-to-Peer if needed. I also need to confirm that the HTTP server binds to all interfaces. For FlyingFox, I’ll suggest using HTTPServer(port: 8088, bindAddress: "0.0.0.0") if that works. If not, we should explore alternatives.
**Exploring connectivity solutions**

It seems the tool might not fetch code details, so I’m thinking about checking SPM checkouts in DerivedData, though they aren’t accessible. Given these constraints, I suggest testing the connection from Safari directly on the iPhone using the same URL. If that works, the server is running, and the “unreachable” error might be due to network isolation. 

I’ll also present a checklist along with a few minor code improvements, focusing on details like the ATS exception and refining the Info.plist entries.
**Providing troubleshooting steps**

The user reports that their phone’s web service shows "unreachable" when accessed from their computer. I suspect the issue could stem from AP isolation or Personal Hotspot restrictions. I'll suggest trying a different Wi-Fi network or enabling communication among clients. 

Also, I need to ensure the HTTPServer binds to all addresses. Minor code improvements should be proposed, like modifying the NSBonjourServices entry in the Info.plist. Lastly, I’ll outline specific steps to troubleshoot, focusing on the environment and connection settings.
I need to be careful while applying changes, particularly with the use of `apply_patch`. Since the file hasn't been opened in the last five messages, I should read it again using `read_file`, even though we read it previously. This is just to be cautious. Once I confirm the contents, I’ll go ahead and modify the `Info.plist` to include the necessary changes. 

After these edits, I'll run a lint check to catch any errors, followed by generating a Chinese Git commit message as required.
I’m planning to proceed with tool calls using `multi_tool_use.parallel` to run `read_file` and `apply_patch`. While these calls need to be sequential to confirm content, I can run multiple `apply_patch` operations in parallel since they target different files.

I’ll update the TODO status before starting any edits, but since we have an in-progress item, there's no need for that. I’ll modify the `Info.plist` for the Bonjour service and the `WebUploadServer.swift` function as planned.

After applying these changes, I’ll run linter checks and update the TODO items accordingly. Then I’ll generate a detailed summary in Chinese with the required bullet points and commit message.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring connectivity issues**

I think I should look into the FlyingFox documentation, but the web search returned generic information. To connect an iOS device to others on a LAN, the OS needs to allow inbound connections if the app is listening on a TCP port, probably binding to all interfaces. The user faced an ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE error, indicating the IP or route isn't reachable from the computer. Possible issues could include network isolation settings or using the wrong server URL.
**Analyzing connection hurdles**

There's a chance the device is using the Wi-Fi Private Address feature, leading to an IP in the 192.168.* range, but it could still be unreachable due to AP isolation, causing that ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE error. 

Additionally, some networks block high ports like 8088, although that's unlikely in a LAN environment. Local Network permissions must be included in the Info.plist, noting NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription and potentially NSBonjourServices for Bonjour. The server might be bound to localhost, so checking the FlyingFox API is essential.
**Investigating server binding issues**

If the default binding covers all interfaces, that’s good, but I should check for any alternate initializer that allows specifying `bindAddress` or `host`. Even though I can't run the code myself, I can look up the Xcode docs for more clarification.

One potential issue is that App Transport Security is only for outbound traffic, so it's not relevant here. The serverURL is pulling the IP from currentWiFiIPv4Address, and I need to confirm we’re selecting the right interface since it might pick en2 or similar for AWDL or P2P connections rather than the actual Wi-Fi connection.
**Refining network interface selection**

The enumeration order for network interfaces is based on how getifaddrs works. There's a chance it could prioritize en2, which might correspond to Apple Wireless Direct Link. However, I've limited options to en* interfaces, meaning it could also pick an address using 169.254.*, which is often unreachable and could lead to that ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE error.

To improve this, I should focus on interfaces that are UP and RUNNING and prefer IPv4 over link-local addresses. I’ll check the interface flags and prioritize en0 first, falling back to en1 if necessary, while also avoiding any 169.254.* addresses.
**Enhancing IP address handling**

Our function currently returns nil if no IPv4 address is found, displaying unhelpful generic text. The connection can still occur via an IPv6 address, which might complicate things for users on a PC. To improve this, I’ll focus on adding support for IPv4 and IPv6 by iterating through interfaces to gather candidate addresses.

I’ll prioritize non-link-local addresses, starting with those named "en0". Additionally, I should check flags, update the NSBonjourServices entry in Info.plist, and make necessary code edits. Afterward, I'll apply patches to improve the handling of currentWiFiIPv4Address.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing connectivity issues**

The user's ER_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE error seems to point to the fact that the browser can't reach that IP from their computer. This often means the phone's IP isn't reachable—possibly due to being on different network segments, client isolation, or using mobile data. If the phone's on Wi-Fi with Private Wi-Fi Address on, it could still be reachable. I'll provide steps like checking if both devices are on the same Wi-Fi, ensuring they're not on a guest network, and checking the IP used to connect.
**Following developer instructions**

I need to follow the developer instructions for using the todo_write tool flows, which include providing status updates before making any tool calls. We've already used tools and included updates, so now it’s time to summarize the changes we made and provide clear steps. The user’s message mentioned a file with "@", but it didn't include "@Commit," so I don't need to commit anything just yet. I should also mention we have a pending todo for "环境排查清单" and produce that checklist before marking the todo as completed.
**Updating tasks and handling server settings**

Following the instructions, I need to use todo for multi-step tasks and provide the environment checklist as part of the content. Once I offer the checklist, I will call todo_write to mark it as completed. The flow indicates that I should call todo_write after finishing tasks, including a status update at the top of my message. Additionally, I should consider binding to 0.0.0.0. If the HTTPServer can’t set the address, we may need to ensure the route is accessible while taking local network permissions into account.
**Understanding local network privacy**

The Apple documentation states that local network privacy affects both inbound and outbound communications. For inbound discovery, we typically need to ensure we have the NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription. While some apps can act as listeners without prompts, triggering the local network permission might involve using NWBrowser or sending UDP requests. Bonjour advertising can help with this, and since we're using NetService publish, that should trigger the prompt effectively. Also, ATS concerns are irrelevant here since it's about inbound server communication from a browser, not outbound HTTP requests. Plus, the app is open, so background restrictions shouldn't be an issue.
**Handling server URL and commit messages**

We need to compute the serverURL carefully. If the IP is unknown, we should show "http://<device-ip>," and potentially include the mDNS address too. It's essential to check if the devices are on the same network without client isolation, ensuring port 8088 is open and not blocked by any firewall. Additionally, I need to address potential issues with personal hotspots. 

Now, regarding the commit message, since the user didn’t request a commit, I’ll generate a Chinese commit message based on the rules. However, since the user hasn’t tagged a commit, I won't auto commit but provide it separately.

Here’s the suggested commit message:
“修复 Bonjour 类型尾点，改进 IP 选择。”
**Providing troubleshooting steps**

I’ll first present the environment checklist after the tool call. Next, I'd include action steps like testing the displayed IP in the app, using ping and curl, and disabling guest Wi-Fi. It’s important to mention that the server should listen on all interfaces, noting that FlyingFox defaults to 0.0.0.0. If connectivity issues persist, I can suggest disabling the "Private Wi-Fi Address" setting.

Also, I’ll provide advice about potential VPN/firewall impacts on a Mac and recommend testing the server directly from the phone using Safari. Lastly, I’ll conclude by asking the user to reconnect using the printed URL and suggest a commit message based on the changes we've made. A summary of these changes will be included, stating no new lint errors were found.</details></think>

## Todo List

- [x] 改进 currentWiFiIPv4Address 选择逻辑（优先 en0、过滤169.254、仅UP/RUNNING）
- [x] 给出环境排查清单（同网段、权限、本地网络隔离、热点限制）

---

- 我已更新：`Info.plist` 的 `NSBonjourServices` 为 `_http._tcp.`（尾点符合 Bonjour 规范）；并增强 `currentWiFiIPv4Address()`：仅取 UP/RUNNING 的 `en*` 接口，优先 `en0`，排除 `169.254.*` 链路本地地址，避免显示不可达的 IP。
- 请在真机重装/运行后测试，用电脑浏览器访问 `http://<iPhone的Wi‑Fi IP>:8088/`。

### 仍无法访问时的排查清单
- 同一网络: 电脑与 iPhone 必须在同一 Wi‑Fi，且同一网段（如都为 `192.168.1.x`）。
- 路由器隔离: 关闭 AP 隔离/客户端隔离/访客网络；部分路由器默认隔离客户端。
- 热点/共享网络: iPhone 个人热点下，旁路设备通常无法反向访问手机服务，改用同一 Wi‑Fi。
- 本地网络权限: iPhone 设置 > 隐私与安全性 > 本地网络，确保已允许该 App。
- 端口冲突: 试过更换端口（例如 `8090`）；重启 App 后再测。
- IP 确认: 以 `设置 > Wi‑Fi > 当前网络 > IP 地址` 为准；避免使用蜂窝/虚拟接口 IP。
- 局域网安全软件: 电脑上的防火墙/安全软件是否拦截到 `:8088` 的出站请求。
- Bonjour/发现: 现已发布 `_http._tcp.`，可用发现工具（如 macOS 的 `dns-sd -B _http._tcp`) 验证广播与解析。

### 如需进一步强化
- 若 FlyingFox 支持绑定地址，考虑显式监听 0.0.0.0（当前版本多为自动监听可用接口）。
- 在 App 内显示检测到的 IP 与可用性状态；提供重试与诊断提示。

若你确认仍报 ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE，请告知路由器型号/是否启用访客网络、两端 IP 段，以及是否在个人热点环境，以便继续定位。

- 变更影响：`Info.plist` 的 Bonjour 服务值修正；`WebUploadServer.swift` 的 IP 选择更稳健，有助于使用正确的 Wi‑Fi IP。

还是同样的提示ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE。模拟器开启web服务后，在手机上可以访问。在电脑中开启一个web服务，手机也能访问。电脑没有开防火墙，和手机在同一个wifi。改成其他端口也是同样的提示。在电脑ping手机的ip是可以ping通的。不知道是否是iOS26改变了什么规则呢？

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting connection issues**

It seems like I'm running into an ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE issue, which means the desktop can't connect to the IP:port. Since the ping works but the port is unreachable, I'm wondering if FlyingFox's HTTPServer might be set to bind only to the loopback address by default. I need to check the FlyingFox documentation for specifics on binding to hosts. It’s odd that it's not in the workspace; I’ll have to search through the source or examine SPM packages for any clues!
**Investigating device connectivity**

It seems like there's a situation with AP isolation being disabled, allowing devices on the same Wi-Fi network to communicate. The phone can access the computer's web server, but the reverse isn't happening. This suggests the computer might be blocked from reaching the phone, possibly by iOS, or the app may not be configured to listen on all interfaces. I should verify if the server accepts external connections by testing with another device. My hypothesis is that FlyingFox's HTTPServer might default to binding only to localhost on iOS. I need to search for more information about this!</details></think>

我先查 FlyingFox 0.25.0 的监听地址与 NWListener 配置，确认是否默认仅绑定回环或需显式传入 0.0.0.0/IPv4。随后给出代码层面的修改建议。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting Network Access**

I need to address the ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE issue when accessing the iOS device web server from a PC. The phone can be pinged, and it connects to the PC web service, but the PC can't reach the phone. This might be related to inbound connections being blocked due to iOS requiring "Local Network" permission. While the app has NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription and uses Bonjour correctly, it's critical to ensure both are properly set to avoid connection issues. Let's explore all necessary settings.
**Investigating Network Issues**

I’m trying to figure out if FlyingFox uses NWListener with Bonjour and how it interacts with the Network framework. There are changes in network entitlements in iOS 15+ that might affect this. I know that there's a multicast entitlement needed for mDNS browsing in iOS 14, but it's unclear if Bonjour advertising requires it. The current error, ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE, shows the PC can't connect to the iPhone web server, even though pinging works. I need to clarify if FlyingFox specifies the correct listening address and how it set up its HTTP server.
**Clarifying HTTPServer Binding**

I’m looking into the initializer for "bindAddress" and how it affects FlyingFox. I can’t browse effectively due to limited search results, but it seems that calling HTTPServer(port:) could default to "localhost." In previous versions, it might have defaulted to INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0), but I'm not sure. The user mentioned that if the web server runs on the Mac simulator, the phone should be able to access it. To resolve this, I think we should try binding explicitly to 0.0.0.0 and check if there’s an initializer for this.
**Examining Network Restrictions**

I’m trying to sift through the remote documentation, but I can’t guarantee clarity. Inspecting with Xcode might help, although iOS 26 feels a bit fictional at this point. According to the repo guidelines, it seems there are new restrictions for inbound local network connections that require adding "NSBonjourServices" for the service type, which is done. I'll also need to check if the app enters the background, as it can suspend NWListener connections. Additionally, I should consider any App Transport Security (ATS) settings that might be affecting connections.
**Analyzing Network Binding Issues**

I’m investigating potential causes for the connection problems between the PC and iPhone. App Transport Security (ATS) affects outgoing connections, but it shouldn't impact inbound server interactions. It’s possible that the PC and iPhone are both preferring IPv6, which could be an issue since the listener might only bind to IPv6 addresses. If that's the case, testing binding options like "0.0.0.0" may be crucial. Additionally, I should consider settings regarding "Wi-Fi Private Address" and recommend that the user checks their router configurations, as client isolation might block TCP while allowing ping requests.
**Exploring Potential Connection Issues**

I’m analyzing the connection difficulties between the iPhone and the PC. I noticed a few possibilities that could be affecting the inbound connections, such as the app's binding configuration, the network topology, or the use of VPN. It's essential to verify the server URL is correct and ensure that both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network. I also want to emphasize testing the open port with tools like `nc -vz` and possibly consider using an alternative server library if needed. Finally, updating the app's binding address to allow both IPv4 and Bonjour service types could be crucial.
**Considering TCP Proxy Solutions**

To prevent compile breaks, I’m thinking about using conditional availability checks, but that might not be helpful. Another option is to create a minimal wrapper using POSIX sockets to forward traffic from 0.0.0.0:8088 to 127.0.0.1:8088. If we can set up a TCP proxy that listens on 0.0.0.0, we could accept external connections. I could write a "PortForwarder" with Network.framework to facilitate this, ensuring not to conflict with existing ports. However, I can't instruct FlyingFox to bind to a specific address due to its API limitations. I need to look up `HTTPServer bindAddress` in the FlyingFox documentation for more clarity.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering connection prompts**

I’m exploring how to address the connection issues. We can test by checking the bound port addresses, but running may not be an option. The content type might not be relevant, and I’m also looking at Bonjour services and whether desktop discoverability is necessary. For iOS 14+, if an app wants incoming connections, it must prompt the user for local network access. I'm considering how to use Bonjour service advertising to help trigger that prompt.
**Examining network permissions**

It looks like the code should start with `NetService.publish()`, which ideally triggers the local network alert. I’m wondering if the user saw the permission prompt because they mentioned having `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`. On iOS 15+, the prompt comes up only for browsing or connecting, not when listening. If permission isn’t granted, inbound connections are blocked, which might be the issue since the PC can't connect. Even though the phone's Safari can access the PC, the app might need local network permissions enabled in Settings.
**Exploring iOS connection issues**

I'm considering another possibility regarding iOS 16+, where inbound connections could be restricted if "BonjourServices" isn't enabled, even though "NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription" is present. The user still seems unreachable. It might be that the server only listens on loopback due to using the port without a bind address; perhaps FlyingFox defaults to .localhost. I want to look into the FlyingFox source but earlier searches yielded generic results. I might need to check derived data or grep through my project workspace for more information, especially regarding the multicast entitlement for newer iOS versions.
**Considering connection alternatives**

I think we should stick to using FlyingFox. Alternatively, I could create a minimal socket listener with `NWListener`, but that might complicate things. Another option is to change the Bonjour advertisement to include `includesPeerToPeer` as false, though that might not help much. I could implement a UDP "poke" using `NWBrowser` to force the local network permission prompt for "_http._tcp". Since our app is the server, scanning with `NWBrowser` could trigger the prompt. I'd also need to remind the user to check if our app is enabled in Settings > Privacy > Local Network.
**Proposing connection steps**

Let’s follow some steps! First, confirm in Settings > Privacy > Local Network that the app is enabled. If it’s not, our Bonjour advertisement might fail to trigger the alert. We’ll implement `NWBrowser` for "_http._tcp" to prompt. Additionally, ensure that the iOS version complies with Bonjour requirements.

Next, we might need to add an IPv6 listener, as the device could be on an IPv6-only network. We should also emphasize checking local network permissions in Settings, especially if the prompt hasn’t been seen. Lastly, I plan to modify `WebUploadServer.swift` to incorporate network permissions and browser triggering.</details></think>

我将先添加一个使用 NWBrowser 的轻量浏览动作来显式触发“本地网络”权限弹窗，然后再运行服务；同时保持现有 Bonjour 广播。接着我会更新代码并检查静态错误。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing network connectivity issues**

Many developers have had success with a "poke" to 255.255.255.255 or using `NWBrowser` for service browsing. Adding `NWBrowser(for: .bonjour(type: "_http._tcp", domain: nil), using: .tcp)` to trigger permission could help. The Info.plist needs the NSBonjourServices for specific service types, including "_http._tcp." It's important to note that since iOS 14+, exact Bonjour service names must be included. The error suggests an unreachable connection, possibly due to iOS using a "Private Wi-Fi Address."
**Reviewing local network permissions**

In iOS 14, Local Network privacy requires permission for any app using the LAN, especially for inbound connections. The app should show a permission prompt on the first connection attempt. If it only listens, it might not trigger a prompt, leading to blocked inbound access until permission is toggled in Settings. The user mentioned their phone can connect to the PC, but it indicates our app might lack the necessary permissions. I should guide the user to enable the app in Settings > Privacy > Local Network.
**Exploring permission and networking requirements**

It seems the user may have missed the prompt for local network permission, which could explain why the setting isn't showing. The Local Network list only shows apps that have requested permission, so if our app hasn’t, it's effectively blocked. To address this, I need to explicitly trigger permission by using NWBrowser to scan for `_http._tcp.` upon startup and stop after `.ready` or a timeout. 

Also, I need to ensure the server can bind to both IPv4 and IPv6 to accommodate different router setups.
**Investigating port and connectivity issues**

There's a chance that using port 8088 might be blocked by iOS's App Sandbox, though typically, high ports are allowed. In iOS 13+, inbound connections should work while the app is in the foreground; I wonder if the user is keeping it open during testing. We can suggest they ensure the app stays in the foreground. 

Also, it's worth checking for settings like personal hotspot or "Wi-Fi Assist." They mentioned they can ping, so it seems okay. I'll calculate the "serverURL" using the current Wi-Fi IPv4 address, which should work on the iPhone.
**Implementing local network permissions**

To enable inbound connections on iOS 14+, I need to ensure the app triggers local network permission by using `NWBrowser` to browse a service type. Currently, the app is publishing a service but not browsing. I'll create a method called `triggerLocalNetworkPermission()` that starts a `NWBrowser`, prompting the user for permission when the app tries to connect. 

Additionally, I’ll make updates to the Info.plist and verify network usage descriptions. We should also instruct the user to run the app once to check if the permission prompt appears and ensure the app is listed in the Local Network settings. 

Lastly, I’ve noted the requirement to generate a Chinese commit message for the changes but won't auto-commit since the user did not include '@Commit'.
**Providing user instructions for permissions**

I need to respond to the user with clear instructions regarding the local network privacy settings on iOS 14+ and possibly stricter rules on iOS 26. I'll outline steps for them: first, they should open the app to allow permission, check their settings, and keep the app in the foreground. It's best to avoid guest networks and test again. If there are still issues, I can suggest toggling the Private Address off. 

Lastly, I’ll mention that if the problem persists, we can consider using Peer-to-Peer via NetService, which includes `includePeerToPeer`.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering UI Changes**

I need to implement a UI adjustment for the settings page, adding a button that opens a web view with a specific URL. This is for an iOS app using SwiftUI, so I think I'll work with the Views/AppSettingsView.swift file. My options include using WKWebView wrapped with UIViewRepresentable or opting for SFSafariViewController. While SFSafariViewController is a modal, “embedded” suggests that WKWebView might be the better choice for accurate functionality. Let's explore these alternatives!
**Computing Phone IP**

I need to compute the phone's IP programmatically. We have a static function, currentWiFiIPv4Address(), in WebUploadServer, but it's private. I could either add a public static computed URL or make the function accessible. A simple solution might be to create a helper function called currentServerURLForLocalNetwork(). The settings page should generate the URL for testing when the server is running, using WebUploadServer.shared.serverURL or calculating it if nil. But we want to ensure it retrieves the correct IP for our test URL.
**Modifying WebUploadServer**

I need to change `WebUploadServer.currentWiFiIPv4Address()` from private to either internal or public so the UI can access it. However, design guidelines lean towards MVVM, so I might consider creating a helper in Utils for computing the local IP. A simpler solution could be to add a computed property like `currentLocalTestURL()` in WebUploadServer that uses the current private method internally. The UI can then call `WebUploadServer.shared.testURL()`, or we might just rely on `webUploadServer.serverURL` if that already meets the requirements. Let’s check AppSettingsView.swift to see how it all fits together.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning web browser integration**

To enable local HTTP connections, I need to add `NSAppTransportSecurity` with `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInLocalNetworking` set to true—that feels like a safe move. The user requested an embedded web browser that points directly to `http://<ip>:8088`. I’ll set up a sheet with a NavigationStack for the WebView, including a toolbar for functions like reload and link copying.

I also need to update `AppSettingsView.swift` by adding a state variable for the web tester sheet and integrating a button. I’m deciding whether to keep `WebTesterView` in the same file or separate for clarity.
**Setting up embedded web view**

I'll start by adding to `Components.swift`. First, I need to import WebKit since we already have SwiftUI imported. I’ll create a struct called `EmbeddedWebView` that conforms to `UIViewRepresentable` and takes a URL. My plan is to implement the update function to reload the URL when it changes.

Next, I’ll provide a `WebTesterSheet` view that uses `EmbeddedWebView`, but since the instruction says to present a popup window, I’ll utilize `.sheet` in SwiftUI for that. I also have to consider Mac Catalyst, but it seems I won't need to implement that part right now.
**Updating AppSettingsView**

In `AppSettingsView`, I’m going to add a state variable called `showingWebProbe` to manage the visibility of the web probe. In `bookImporterView()`, I’ll include a button with the label "用内置浏览器测试". This button will set `showingWebProbe` to true when clicked, but I’ll disable it if `serverURL` is nil.

Next, I’ll implement a `.sheet` that presents a NavigationStack with the `WebViewContainer` if the URL is available, or show a message if not. I also need to import WebKit in the right swift file and update the `Info.plist` for local networking permissions. However, I’ll follow best practices by only allowing local networking loads for security reasons.
**Implementing code changes**

I’m ready to implement the necessary code edits in a structured way. First, I’m creating a todo list for this multi-step feature that includes: 1) Adding an embedded WKWebView component, 2) Including a button and sheet in `AppSettingsView`, and 3) Updating ATS for local networking.

I'll begin by writing the tasks and setting the first one as in progress. Then, I’ll apply patches to `Components.swift` to import WebKit and add the `WebViewContainer` as well as the `WebTesterView`. Next, I’ll update `AppSettingsView.swift` to include the required state, button, and sheet. I'll also check the `Info.plist` for the ATS key and maintain good coding practices throughout. 

The user mentioned a Chinese commit message, but they hadn’t requested a commit yet. So, I’ll keep that in mind for later too!</details></think>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating iOS Settings for WKWebView**

I need to add a button on the settings page that opens an in-app web browser (WKWebView) to a specified local IP. I have to consider App Transport Security (ATS) settings which might block HTTP loads unless I enable certain options like allowsArbitraryLoads or allowsLocalNetworking. 

I’m realizing there are keys involved, such as NSAppTransportSecurity and various allowances, which I need to clarify to ensure correct implementation without errors, especially since ATS generally doesn't block inbound servers.
**Implementing WKWebView with ATS Considerations**

I’m planning for the WKWebView to load HTTP content from the phone's local IP. Without an ATS exception, it may block non-HTTPS requests, despite Safari being able to load them. To allow HTTP in WKWebView, I should set NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent or NSAllowsLocalNetworking in the Info.plist. I'm not sure which is safer, but I think adding both might be best. 

I need to ensure no linter errors occur when I edit Info.plist. Also, I’ll create a WKWebView wrapper using SwiftUI, possibly in a new file for clarity.
**Creating a Web View Implementation**

I’m looking to create a new file in the Views, maybe calling it `WebPreviewSheet.swift` or `EmbeddedWebView.swift`. In the AppSettingsView, I’ll add some state with `@State private var showingWebTester = false`. 

I also need to get the current IP address, but it seems like `currentWiFiIPv4Address()` in WebUploadServer is private, which complicates things. I might need to use `webServer.serverURL` instead, generating the URL based on that. If it isn’t set, I’ll default to "http://localhost:\(webPort)/".
**Configuring In-App Web Testing**

The user wants the phone's IP for testing. If `serverURL` isn’t nil, we’ll use that IP and show it. I’ll set up a navigation toolbar with options like refresh, and maybe an open-in-Safari feature. I will implement a SwiftUI sheet for `EmbeddedWebTesterView(url: url)` triggered by a button labeled "内置浏览器测试" near the web server controls, which only activates when `webServer.isRunning` and `serverURL` exists.

I’ll also need to import WebKit and modify Info.plist to add necessary ATS settings to allow non-encrypted connections. I'm cautious about the inbound connections and ensure that everything is configured properly!
**Implementing WebTesterView and ATS Modifications**

I realized we didn’t change the earlier setup. It’s possible that FlyingFox only binds to all addresses on NWListener, preventing desktop connections due to iOS 26 restrictions. There might be a “Enable Local Network Privacy entitlement” in play. Plus, Apple may block inbound connections when the device is locked.

The user’s task involves adding a button for testing with an embedded browser, so I’ll create a new file: `WebTesterView.swift`. This will feature a `WebViewRepresentable` for displaying the web content and a minimal UI. I also need to modify `AppSettingsView` to include the button, ensuring proper functionality and indentation. Now I’ll proceed with the tool calls and updates!</details></think>

已在设置页“导入小说”区添加“内置浏览器测试”按钮，并实现弹窗内嵌浏览器访问当前 `webServer.serverURL`。

使用方式
- 在 App 内开启“Web 上传服务”后，点击“内置浏览器测试”。
- 弹出的视图会直接加载形如 `http://<手机IP>:8088/` 的页面，可点右上角“刷新”。

变更要点
- 新增 `Views/WebTesterView.swift`（基于 WKWebView 的 SwiftUI 封装）。
- 更新 `Views/AppSettingsView.swift`：添加 `showingWebTester` 状态、按钮与 `.sheet` 展示。
- 更新 `Info.plist`：加入 `NSAppTransportSecurity` 的 `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads`，确保 WKWebView 允许 HTTP 加载。

如果弹窗中能打开，但电脑浏览器仍报 ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE，说明服务在本机可达、跨设备被阻。结合你环境已允许本地网络/无隔离，建议额外验证：
- 用电脑 `curl http://<手机IP>:8088/` 看响应。
- 路由器“AP 隔离/访客网络”确已关闭；若开启了“单独 2.4/5G 频段隔离”，尝试让两端在同一频段或同一 AP。
- 若启用 iCloud 私网中继/企业安全软件，临时关闭测试。
- 尝试换一台电脑或同网段另一手机访问该 iPhone 的地址，排除单机策略。
