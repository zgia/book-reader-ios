# 添加新功能和分类管理 (2025-09-27 01:14Z)

_**User (2025-09-27 00:44Z)**_

添加几个功能：
1、分类菜单，选择某个分类后，则分类按钮高亮，即给图标line.3.horizontal.decrease一个背景色；选择全部分类后，移除背景色
2、分类管理视图，每个分类显示其下的图书数量
3、在系统设置中，添加一个开关功能，”开启”后则隐藏分类管理中已经“隐藏的分类”，“关闭”则显示“隐藏的分类”
4、图书信息页面给图书添加分类时，会列出分类，目前不显示隐藏的分类，请更改逻辑：当系统设置的开关“开启”时，不显示隐藏的分类；当系统设置的开关关闭时，则显示隐藏的分类

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing UI Changes**

I'm focusing on changing button styles in SwiftUI, like using ZStack or RoundedRectangle for background effects. When the menu label is an Image, I can still apply a background based on whether a category is selected. For instance, if `selectedCategoryId` isn't nil, I could use a background with some material or a color accent. 

Okay, I need to keep track of categories in `CategoryView`, including book counts. Lastly, I'm considering a toggle option in `AppSettingsView` to hide hidden categories, possibly using `UserDefaults` for that.
**Adjusting Category Visibility**

I'm working on the logic for the book info page's category assignment. Right now, hidden categories aren't shown, and I need to change that based on a toggle. If the toggle is on, hidden categories should be hidden; if off, they should be displayed. 

I'll begin by exploring the relevant code files like `BookListView.swift`, `CategoryView.swift`, and `AppSettingsView.swift`. We also need to check how categories are fetched in the database, specifically looking at the `fetchCategories(includeHidden: Bool)` function to ensure it respects the toggle setting.
**Refining Category Management Logic**

It looks like the requirement didn't specify changing the menu's hide behavior, just the button highlight. I might keep it as is for now.

For the category management view, I’ll need to show the book count per category. The Category object probably includes an id, title, and an 'isHidden' property, which I can check in `Models.swift`. If Repositories.swift doesn’t have a method to count books by category, I’ll need to implement one or create a SQL query to do that. 

Additionally, I want to add a toggle in `AppSettingsView` to control hiding hidden categories in the management view, as specified.
**Adjusting Visibility Logic for Categories**

I noticed that point 4 uses the same toggle to determine whether to hide or show hidden categories on the BookInfo page. So, this toggle will affect both the category management and the BookInfo category selection.

To proceed, I’ll update `CategoryView` to use `db.fetchCategories(includeHidden: toggleIsOff?)`, where if "开启" (on) is selected, it hides hidden categories. This means `includeHidden` should be false when toggled on and true when toggled off.

I'll also update `BookInfoView` to reflect these changes in the categories listing and check `DefaultsKeys.swift` for consistent patterns. Reading the relevant files in parallel will help.</details></think>

我先快速查阅相关的 Swift 文件，定位分类视图、设置页、仓库接口与模型定义，以便实现分类按钮高亮、分类计数，以及设置开关影响分类显示。随后我会根据查阅结果直接进行代码编辑。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing features for BookListView**

I'm focusing on implementing four features. First, I need to highlight the category menu button when a category is selected, using a background color when `selectedCategoryId` is not nil. I'll use SwiftUI, likely wrapping the label with a ZStack or applying styling for better visibility. 

Next, I'll ensure that clicking "category.all" resets `selectedCategoryId`, which should clear the highlight. In the category management view, I'm adding a book count display for each category, aligning with the existing category fetching logic.
**Finding book counts method**

I need to determine how to retrieve book counts, so I'll check the `Repositories.swift` file for the relevant data methods. This involves opening the file to explore the current implementation. I want to ensure I understand how the data is structured and how I can access the necessary book count information effectively. It’s important that I find the most efficient way to do this to maintain optimal performance in the project.</details></think>

我将并行读取 `Repositories.swift` 和 `Models.swift` 以查找分类与图书计数的方法，并确认是否已有设置项可控制隐藏分类的显示。随后我会根据结果实施必要的代码编辑。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing features for app**

I need to roll out four key features. First, the category menu needs to highlight the selected category with a background when chosen and remove the background when "all" is selected. In SwiftUI, I could use a ZStack to achieve this, applying a capsule background color if a category is selected. 

Second, the category management view must display each category alongside the book count. I’ll compute the count for each using the ForEach loop in the CategoryView. There’s a few details to sort through, but I have a plan!
**Adding functionality for categories**

I need to develop some options here. First, I'll create a function to count books per category, which could return a mapping of counts. I might name it `fetchCategoryCounts`, which will return counts based on a SQL query, though I need to consider that some books might have a category ID of 0 (uncategorized). 

Next, I want to add a toggle in the settings. This will let users hide or show hidden categories in the management view. I’ll check where to pull this toggle from the app settings. Let's dive into that!</details></think>

---

我将并行读取 `AppSettingsView.swift` 和 `AppAppearanceSettings.swift` 以确认是否已有相关设置状态管理，并定位在哪里添加“隐藏隐藏分类”的开关。随后我会据此修改 `CategoryView` 与分类选择逻辑。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering category management**

I need to show the number of books in each category. First, I should create a function to count books per category. In Repositories.swift, I could add `fetchCategoryBookCount()`. However, a simpler approach might be augmenting `CategoryView` to compute counts using a database function. For performance, I could implement `fetchCategoryStats()`, which retrieves counts in one query. I could return a dictionary that maps category IDs to counts, with an ID for uncategorized books, considering whether to include hidden categories.
**Implementing category toggle**

I need to add a toggle in system settings that manages hidden categories in category management. When it’s ON, categories labeled as hidden should not be displayed, and when it’s OFF, they should be visible. Previously, `CategoryView` always showed all categories. Now, with this toggle, we'll need to refer to an application-wide setting stored in `AppAppearanceSettings`.

I think I should create a new section in `AppSettingsView` labeled "分类" or "显示," which has the toggle option for "仅显示可见分类." It seems easiest to extend `AppAppearanceSettings` with `@AppStorage("HideHiddenCategoriesInManagement") var hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement: Bool = false`, which I'll use when loading categories in `CategoryView`.
**Adjusting category visibility**

I need to use `@EnvironmentObject private var appAppearance: AppAppearanceSettings` in `CategoryView`, `BookListView`, and `BookInfoView` to manage category visibility based on the toggle. For `BookInfoView`, I'll change the logic to fetch categories so that when the toggle is ON, hidden categories will be filtered out. If it's OFF, they should appear. 

In `BookListView`, I'll implement similar logic for building menus. I do need to be careful, as `loadBooks` also seems to filter hidden categories, but the request doesn’t mention changing that part. It’s just about the displayed categories.
**Considering hidden category logic**

It might be okay to keep filtering hidden categories in `fetchBooks`, but there's a concern for users selecting a hidden category when the toggle is OFF; `fetchBooks` would filter those out and could leave the book list empty, which might be unexpected. Although the requirements focus on showing/hiding in category selection, they didn’t mention browsing hidden categories.

To address this, when a user selects a hidden category, I could automatically revert to show all books. Currently, `loadBooks` checks visible categories and resets the selected category ID if it's not visible.
**Modifying category selection logic**

If the toggle is OFF and a user selects a hidden category, then `loadBooks` will set the `selectedCategoryId` to nil, resulting in fetching all books. This means the selection won't persist, but maybe that’s acceptable since the menu will close, and the previous selections won’t show anymore. 

I need to make a few modifications: 

First, I'll add a new `@AppStorage` Bool property in `AppAppearanceSettings`, possibly with a function to toggle it. While `AppAppearanceSettings` is an ObservableObject, and I'm unsure how `@AppStorage` interacts with it. It seems better to store this using a UserDefaults wrapper instead. I should check `DefaultsKeys.swift` for guidance.</details></think>

---

我将查看 `DefaultsKeys.swift` 以复用现有的偏好存储封装，再在设置中添加开关并在视图中读取。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering category settings**

I'm pondering whether the list for "dynamic category items" in the BookListView Menu should also control hidden categories. The user’s request regarding the BookInfo page doesn’t seem to apply to menu dynamics. They’ve pointed out that the system setting impacts certain areas, but not the menu. I’ll keep hidden categories excluded in the BookListView. Also, I'll update CategoryView to use the correct inclusion setting for hidden categories and add a method to fetch category book counts.
**Implementing category count functionality**

I’m planning to add a function called `fetchCategoryBookCounts()` to get a mapping of category IDs to their respective book counts. It seems we'll handle categories appropriately, even with an ID for uncategorized books that won’t be included in the CategoryView. I’ll ensure this function populates the `counts` state in CategoryView and displays the count beside each category title, possibly with a badge style to keep it clean. Also, I'll update BookListView's highlight functionality for the toolbar.
**Adding UI for system settings**

I need to include a "系统设置中的开关" UI in the AppSettingsView, specifically a new section titled "分类" or "分类显示," which currently doesn't exist. I’m considering whether to use existing localized strings or raw strings for minimal modification. While adding i18n can be a bit of overhead, the fallback mechanism in SwiftUI could pose risks if keys don’t exist. It's okay to add minimal new keys for localization, so I’ll create entries like "category.settings.title" and "category.settings.hide_hidden_categories" for zh-Hans and en localizable files.
**Considering Chinese localization**

While the user didn't specifically ask for a translation, I think adding support for Simplified Chinese could enhance product quality. For now, I’m thinking of using `Text("隐藏隐藏的分类")`, which is fine. Although the codebase uses `String(localized:)`, sticking to that might keep things consistent, even if it’s simpler to use plain strings. I’ll make sure to add Chinese keys in Localizable.strings to support this. Although adding across multiple files may take some time, I’ll ensure the modified files are tracked with `git_status`.
**Planning code updates**

I’ll be updating several files like Repositories.swift, BookListView.swift, and others to add new keys and functionalities. For instance, we’ll remove background colors when all categories are selected and ensure CategoryView reflects settings toggled in AppSettingsView.

I need to create a todo list for multi-step edits, such as highlighting the category filter button and adding book counts in CategoryView. Even though there are guidelines for commit messages in Chinese, we won’t commit now since the user didn’t include "@Commit." I’ll proceed by implementing the necessary code changes and keeping track of progress.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering settings management**

I’m thinking about how to handle a persisted setting, like adding `hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement` to `DefaultsKeys`. Should I create a new observable object or extend `AppAppearanceSettings`? But since that’s appearance-only, maybe making a new `AppSettings` store is better. For simplicity, I could add a new `@AppStorage` property where needed, but centralizing it in an `AppPreferences` object seems more organized. If I go that route, I’ll also need to modify `BookReaderApp.swift` to inject it.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing features for categories**

I need to create a category menu that highlights the filter icon with a background color when selected. The plan involves wrapping the Image in a ZStack with a background circle and possibly using .padding(6) with a RoundedRectangle. I also want the highlight to persist when the menu is closed. I’ll set selectedCategoryId to nil for "All". I also need to build a management view to show each category's book count, requiring a repository function that currently doesn’t exist.
**Fetching category counts and settings**

I need to create a method for fetching category counts, perhaps called `fetchCategoryWithCounts`. This could involve executing an SQL query to get the count alongside category details. However, our existing Category struct doesn’t have a count field, so maybe I should add a new method like `categoryBookCounts() -> [Int: Int]`. This would allow us to retrieve and display both categories and their counts in the UI. 

Additionally, we need to implement a system setting to toggle the visibility of hidden categories in the CategoryView, storing this preference in UserDefaults.
**Implementing category hiding toggle**

I need to create a switch for hiding hidden categories specifically within category management, which is different from the current usage that utilizes `includeHidden` flags in `fetchCategories`. Right now, the `BookListView` shows categories without hidden ones. For `CategoryView`, I’m calling `db.fetchCategories(includeHidden: true)` and need to make it conditional based on the toggle. I’ll define an `AppSettings` object to manage this boolean in `@AppStorage`. 

This should help keep changes minimal while ensuring the toggle is referenced directly in `CategoryView` and checked in `BookInfoView`.
**Updating category visibility in settings**

I need to adjust the logic in `BookInfoView` to ensure hidden categories display based on the toggle switch. When the switch is "开启" (on), hidden categories shouldn’t show; when "关闭" (off), they should. I’ll implement a new key in `DefaultsKeys.hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement` and create a section in `AppSettingsView`. I plan to add a toggle bound to `@AppStorage` for managing this setting, likely defaulting it to `true` to maintain the current behavior of showing all categories. 

But, saying that, it might be better to default to `false` to align with the user's expectations.
**Finalizing category management updates**

I’ve decided to set the default for hiding categories to false, maintaining the current behavior. I will implement a toggle under a new section called "分类与库." The CategoryView will modify the `load()` function to fetch categories based on the toggle's state. 

Also, I’ll adapt the BookInfoView to adjust the inclusion of hidden categories according to the toggle. Users will see updated counts for visible categories only. It’s crucial to implement new methods in the DatabaseManager to compute counts appropriately. Additionally, I'll address the UI details for highlighting selected categories and set up localization strings for the new settings, even if it's not strictly necessary. 

Now, I’m ready to implement the changes in code, ensuring everything is seamless and functional across the app.</details></think>

我将开始实现：先为 `BookListView` 的分类筛选图标添加选中高亮背景；再为 `DatabaseManager` 增加分类图书计数方法，并在 `CategoryView` 展示计数；随后在 `DefaultsKeys` 和 `AppSettingsView` 添加“隐藏隐藏分类”开关，并让 `CategoryView` 与 `BookInfoView` 按开关过滤。接下来我会直接对相关文件进行编辑。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing book count feature**

I’m working on the `Repositories.swift` file. I need to implement a function called `fetchBookCountByCategory()` that will perform a database query to count books grouped by their category. I should also ensure that I handle the 0 category ID correctly, even though categories will have IDs greater than zero. In `CategoryView`, I’ll update the `@State var bookCounts` to show these counts in the UI, perhaps using a badge or label. Lastly, I’ll add a toggle in settings for showing or hiding hidden categories.
**Creating a new settings manager**

I’m thinking of adding a new Settings manager with environment injection. Currently, `BookReaderApp` provides app appearance only. I’ll use `@AppStorage` in both `CategoryView` and `BookInfoView` to manage a toggle for hiding hidden categories. The default could be true. The semantics suggest I should add a switch in the system settings that, when enabled, hides hidden categories, and when disabled, shows them. I need to consider where to best place this toggle in the settings.
**Implementing category settings and logic**

I’m considering using direct text for now, even though guidelines suggest localized strings. I’ll add a new section in `AppSettingsView` for category settings with a toggle bound to `@AppStorage(DefaultsKeys.categoryHideHiddenInManagement)`. I need to create a new function called `categorySettingsView()` for this section.

Additionally, in `BookInfoView`, I must adjust the logic so that hidden categories are shown based on the toggle setting. I’ll use `db.fetchCategories(includeHidden: !hideHidden)` to reflect the user’s preferences correctly.
**Adjusting book list and settings logic**

I need to change the logic in `BookListView` to fetch categories, but since the user didn’t specifically request updates to this view, I think I'll leave it as is for now. Their focus seems to be on category management and adding categories in the book info page. 

I’ll update the `DefaultsKeys` to include a new key for `categoryHideHiddenInManagement`. This will be used for both filtering in `CategoryView` and `BookInfoView`. I’ll also add a toggle in `AppSettingsView` that defaults to true.
**Implementing category toggle and updates**

I’ll add a label for the category toggle, using `String(localized: "category.hide_hidden_toggle")`, even though localization isn't strictly necessary. I’m also considering adding a descriptive footer, but it may not be needed.

In `CategoryView`, I’ll include an `@AppStorage` key and modify `load()` to fetch categories based on the toggle. The same applies to `BookInfoView`. I’ll also add a function in `Repositories.swift` to count books by category, including uncategorized ones.

For `CategoryView`’s UI, I’ll display a count badge for each category. Lastly, I’ll run `read_lints` on the modified files to catch any issues before final implementation.</details></think>

我刚完成分类筛选按钮的高亮，现在将实现分类数量统计、新的设置开关，并让分类管理视图和图书信息页依据开关过滤隐藏分类。接下来我会修改多个文件，并在完成后检查代码质量。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering implementation options**

It looks like they're asking to apply a toggle for managing visibility in both the CategoryView and BookInfoView. When the toggle is On, hidden categories will be hidden in both views. I’m thinking of possibly creating a new AppPreference Settings object, but maybe extending the existing AppAppearanceSettings to include a boolean for hiding categories is a quicker approach. However, introducing another environment object could complicate things, so I might lean towards using UserDefaults directly for simplicity.
**Implementing toggle for categories**

I’ll add a DefaultsKeys constant for managing the hidden categories in the app. This includes creating a static key for "HideHiddenCategoriesInManagement," which might also be used in the BookInfoView. In the AppSettingsView, I’ll add a toggle labeled "隐藏隐藏的分类," linked to the @AppStorage value for the key. I’m considering defaulting this value to true, as it aligns with the current behavior of filtering hidden categories in BookInfoView. This toggle won’t affect the BookListView menu, so I’ll add a section header for categories too.
**Deciding on localization approach**

I need to think about localization for the app’s categories. While it's preferable to use localized keys like `String(localized: "category.preference")`, I might encounter missing keys. To avoid compilation issues, I could use a simple `Text("分类")` for the header. Although unknown localized keys would produce strings at runtime, showing those keys is acceptable in some cases. For the toggle, while I could use `String(localized:)`, I think I’ll stick with `Text("隐藏隐藏的分类")` to keep it simple and consistent.
**Updating category views**

I need to modify the `load()` function in `CategoryView` to check the `hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement` toggle. I’ll read the @AppStorage variable like this: `@AppStorage(DefaultsKeys.hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement) private var hideHiddenCats: Bool = true`. When loading categories, I’ll set it to `includeHidden: !hideHiddenCats`. To ensure updates happen when toggled, I can use `.onChange(of: hideHiddenCats)` to reload the categories. 

In `BookInfoView`, I also need to adjust how categories load using the same toggle decision. I'll apply that logic to both the appearance and the button actions.
**Finalizing implementation details**

I’m aligning the requirements with the toggle logic: when it’s ON, we'll hide categories by setting `includeHidden` to false, and when OFF, we’ll show them by setting it to true. 

Regarding the book count in `CategoryView`, I think filtering the matching categories instead of calculating all counts is a better approach. I’ll need to ensure I address linter warnings after making these changes and proceed to implement. Additionally, there are patches needed for `DefaultsKeys`, `AppSettingsView`, and both `CategoryView` and `BookInfoView`. I’ll apply those changes now!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating category management**

To implement the feature, we’ll set up the `includeHidden` toggle based on `appAppearance.hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement`. The `fetchCategories(includeHidden:)` function will determine if hidden categories are shown. When toggling to hide, the `CategoryView` should update to reflect this. I think adding an `.onChange` method for `appAppearance.hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement` will help reload the view. Counts for categories shouldn’t change based on visibility; they should reflect actual counts, even for hidden categories, and I’ll add an `EnvironmentObject` in `CategoryView`.
**Updating environment objects**

Since the `AppSettingsView` is linked to `BookListView`, they share environment objects. I’ll make the necessary edits there. For `BookInfoView`, I’ll add `@EnvironmentObject appAppearance`. When fetching categories upon `onAppear` and when opening the sheet, I’ll set `includeHidden` based on `appAppearance.hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement`. I need to adjust both instances of category assignment and in the category editable row before showing the sheet. 

I'll keep the category menu as it is since the requirement didn’t change for it, but maybe adding an `onChange` to update `categoriesVersion` is a good idea for `CategoryView` and `BookInfoView`.
**Implementing localization updates**

I’m planning to add localization keys for both zh-Hans and en.lproj. For zh-Hans, I’ll include titles and tips related to category display, ensuring we translate appropriately. Examples include "分类显示" for "category.display.title" and tips about hiding categories.

For en.lproj, I’ll match those with the English equivalents. I need to be careful to preserve the encoding and formatting of the existing strings files, so I'll take a moment to read those files to maintain style and encoding consistency.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing features**

I've successfully implemented several requested features. First, I highlighted the category button when selected, which is great! Second, I added a book count display per category. But I wonder if they want the count excluding uncategorized books, which they may expect from our grouping query. For the system settings, I’ve added a toggle to hide or display hidden categories in the management view. Lastly, I need to adjust the BookInfoPage category list logic based on that toggle.
**Updating category visibility**

I've updated the BookInfoView to use the includeHidden setting based on whether hidden categories should be shown. When fetching categories, the mapping is set to respect the toggle for hiding hidden categories. Good! I’ve also updated the button to refresh categories accordingly. 

Since the user didn’t ask to filter the category menu items by the toggle, I think it’s safe to leave the filtering as it is for now. However, it does seem they want hidden categories hidden in the management view when the toggle is enabled.
**Updating localization and settings**

We added new keys to localization for the section and updated DefaultsKeys, which shouldn’t affect compilation. However, I noticed an edge case: we changed the recorded property for hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement but didn’t call objectWillChange. The @AppStorage property wrapper triggers this automatically in ObservedObjects, but it may not work the same with classes used as EnvironmentObjects. I should confirm if changes will trigger objectWillChange when using the Toggle bound to the property. Fortunately, the CategoryView uses onChange to reload, so it should monitor the value effectively.
**Investigating view updates**

I need to figure out how onChange works with the `appAppearance.hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement`. It seems like referencing it in the view body might not make SwiftUI observe changes properly. If the environment object doesn’t publish updates, the view might not rebuild. Since the property doesn’t trigger objectWillChange and won’t notify the view, I think adding a didSet to send objectWillChange could work. However, doing this with the @AppStorage property wrapper isn't straightforward, so I could consider implementing a setter method instead.
**Implementing property updates and finalizing tasks**

I’m working on the Toggle binding to the property, wrapping it using a computed property to bridge to @AppStorage. This means I’ll change the existing hideHiddenCategories property to a private stored variable and create a computed variable that calls objectWillChange.send(). I’ll also modify the CategoryView to reload when there’s a notification about category changes.

Before concluding everything, I should generate a status update and finalize tasks with todo_write, ensuring all are marked as completed. Since the user didn't include "@Commit", we won't auto-commit. Let’s proceed with these updates!</details></think>

  - 图书信息页：分类选择列表按开关控制隐藏分类的显示逻辑。

- 关键改动：
  - `BookListView.swift`：为分类筛选图标添加选中高亮背景。
  - `Repositories.swift`：新增 `fetchBookCountsByCategory()`。
  - `CategoryView.swift`：展示分类计数；按设置开关过滤；监听开关变化自动刷新。
  - `AppAppearanceSettings.swift`：新增 `hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement`。
  - `DefaultsKeys.swift`：新增键 `hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement`。
  - `AppSettingsView.swift`：新增“分类显示”分区与开关。
  - `BookInfoView.swift`：按开关决定 `fetchCategories(includeHidden:)` 的参数。
  - `Localizable.strings`（中英文）：新增分类计数与设置项的本地化文案。

- 说明：
  - “分类菜单”的项目仍使用 `db.fetchCategories(includeHidden: false)`，与需求一致；当开关开启时，`CategoryView` 与 `BookInfoView` 会隐藏“隐藏的分类”，关闭时则显示。
  - 已通过静态检查，无新增 linter 报错。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing UI Changes**

I need to make two changes in CategoryView.swift. First, I’ll replace the "显示/隐藏" text labels with icons at the very beginning of the category row. Currently, the hiddenText is combined with countText as a caption under the title. Instead, I’ll add an icon to indicate visibility next to the title in the HStack. I'll use SF Symbols: "eye" for visible and "eye.slash" for hidden. Additionally, I’ll keep the count caption while removing the text label.
**Updating Category View**

I see that the user's recent edits added "hiddenText・countText" under the title. Now, they want to replace that with just countText and add an icon at the front instead of the text. So, I’ll show only countText under the title, keeping the "・" as a join. 

I’ll need to make the following changes: in the HStack, I will add an icon using Image(systemName: cat.ishidden == 1 ? "eye.slash" : "eye"). 

In the BookInfoView, I’ll also add the same visibility icon for the category selection sheet to enhance intuitiveness.
**Adjusting Category Icons and TODOs**

For the "全部分类" row, I won’t include any visibility icons since they're not needed. I'll also consider the toggle for "hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement" which filters hidden categories. If this toggle is off, I'll need to display the relevant icons. The code already accommodates loading categories based on the appAppearance, so I just need to update that section accordingly.

Regarding indentation, I’ll maintain the existing 4 spaces in Swift files without introducing tabs. I’ll check the Localizable strings, but since no new labels are required, there’s no need for changes.

Lastly, I’ll add two items to the TODO list: changing labels to icons in the CategoryView and adding icons in the BookInfoView selection list. Using TODOs seems like the best approach for this multi-step task!
**Updating Code for Visibility Icons**

I need to mark tasks as in_progress and complete them using the appropriate tools, providing status updates per the specifications before any tool calls. 

In CategoryView.swift, I’ll focus on the ForEach loop for the cat row. The current code spans lines 38-87, where I’ll modify the HStack content. I’ll add a leading Image for visibility using either "eye.slash" or "eye" based on the hidden state. 

In BookInfoView.swift, I’ll also add the visibility icon before the title in the selection list within the ForEach loop, possibly placing it under the title as well. I’ll make sure to avoid duplicating font modifiers in the process.
**Implementing Changes and Patches**

For the sheet display, I need to add an icon at the front of each item while keeping imports unchanged. It looks like the categoryEditableRow is already set to fetch categories on tap with the toggle, so that’s good! 

I’ll implement the necessary patches using apply_patch, making sure to respect existing indentation. After the edits, I’ll run read_lints on the modified files, but I won’t commit automatically since the user didn’t include "@Commit" in their message. 

I’ll provide concise final answers in Chinese and summarize the progress. Lastly, I’ll close the todo list, confirming all tasks are marked completed and reconciling the summary using todo_write with merge.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing UI Changes**

I need to focus on modifying the CategoryView. The user requested replacing the "显示/隐藏" text with icons at the start of each category row to make it more intuitive. They want to add an icon, possibly an "eye" for visible and "eye.slash" for hidden, in an HStack at the beginning. We could eliminate the "显示/隐藏" text and keep just the icon and count, with the option to retain "hiddenText" as an accessibility label.
**Updating BookInfoView**

The user requested adding visible/hidden icons in the BookInfoView sheet list of categories. This way, users can easily view category information. The logic involves toggling visibility through `appAppearance.hideHiddenCategoriesInManagement`. When toggled off, hidden categories show their icons, while toggled on, hidden categories won't display. I need to modify two files, specifically `CategoryView.swift`, to include an icon at the start of HStack, using `Image(systemName: iconName).foregroundColor(.secondary)`. I’ll ensure to keep the formatting intact.
**Updating BookInfoView.swift**

I need to modify `BookInfoView.swift` to enhance the sheet list. In the existing `ForEach(categories)` loop, I can add an icon before the `Text(cat.title)` within the HStack. The icon will reflect visibility, using `Image(systemName: cat.ishidden==1 ? "eye.slash" : "eye").foregroundColor(.secondary)`. I’ll ensure consistency with the `CategoryView` and check accessibility arrangements. Then, I’ll run lints and update the todo list statuses accordingly, applying concise updates before applying patches. Lastly, I must confirm the added code compiles.
**Restructuring HStack for Icons**

I need to restructure the HStack in `BookInfoView.swift` to enhance the UI. I'll add the icon before the VStack at the beginning of the row. The user wants to remove "显示/隐藏" text and keep only the count in the caption, so I'll eliminate the hiddenText from there. I’ll retain "countText" for clarity and consider keeping hiddenText as an accessibility label, but it might be excessive. I'll also clean up duplicate `.font` and `.foregroundColor` lines to streamline the code while maintaining proper formatting.
**Implementing Icon Updates**

I need to implement changes in `BookInfoView.swift`. First, I'll determine the `iconName` based on `cat.ishidden`, using "eye.slash" for hidden categories and "eye" for visible ones. I'll add the icon with `Image(systemName: iconName).foregroundColor(.secondary)` before `Text(countText)` to replace the `hiddenText`. 

For organization, I'll find the relevant HStack in the ForEach categories and make adjustments. Even though the "All Category" row won’t need an icon, I’ll ensure everything else is consistent. Once I finish, I'll run lints and update the todo list, but I'll hold off on committing for now.</details></think>

我将更新 `CategoryView.swift` 与 `BookInfoView.swift`：在分类行首与分类选择列表项中加入可见性图标（eye/eye.slash），并移除“显示/隐藏”文字，仅保留数量文案。随后我会检查代码并勾选对应待办。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering commit message requirements**

I see that we need to produce a commit message after making changes, but the dev tool spec indicates we should only commit if instructed. So, I'll create a useful commit message without running an auto-commit. I think I'll craft something in Chinese, likely under the feat category since these are new UI features. While the last request was about icon changes, there were multiple modified files. The message can summarize those changes clearly, so it points out what we actually did.
**Formatting commit message correctly**

I need to make sure each line of the commit message is 72 characters or less while following the template. The final message should remain concise, including "status update" and "summary." I’ll mention what changes have been made without heavy formatting; code blocks for clarity are okay. Since we've already reconciled the TODO list and completed all tasks, I'll confirm what was implemented and note that localization remains unaffected. Lastly, I may mention the removal of duplicate .font lines in CategoryView briefly.
**Preparing commit message**

I'm aiming to create a brief confirmation that states we added eye/eye.slash icons to the CategoryView’s header and removed the show/hide text while keeping the count. The same icons will be added to the BookInfoView category selection. 

For the commit message, it should be under the "feat(category)" section, with a body of 1 to 3 bullet points. Each line needs to stay within 72 characters and be in Chinese. I’ll finish by including it in a fenced code block while ensuring only relevant sections are formatted. Let's get started!</details></think>

已完成：
- CategoryView：在分类行最前面加入可见性图标（eye/eye.slash），去除“显示/隐藏”文字，仅保留“共X本”计数。
- BookInfoView：分类选择列表中为每个分类加入相同的可见性图标，直观显示分类状态。

可直接使用的提交信息：
```
feat(category): 分类可见性改为图标展示

- CategoryView 行首加入 eye/eye.slash 图标，替代文字显示/隐藏
- CategoryView 仅保留分类计数“共X本”，信息更简洁直观
- BookInfoView 分类选择列表加入同样可见性图标，便于识别

```
