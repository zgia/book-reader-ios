# 打开第三方文件并提示用户刷新 (2025-10-04 02:41Z)

_**User (2025-10-04 01:18Z)**_

第三方的文件，可以使用本App打开，将文件保存到Uploads目录下，并提示用户去系统里刷新上传的文件，再进行导入

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing file handling feature**

I need to implement a feature that allows third-party files to be opened with the app. This involves using the iOS share sheet or document picker, saving to the Uploads directory under Documents, and prompting the user to refresh their files for import. I'll explore the Swift code in `WebUploadServer.swift`, paying attention to the Uploads directory path. I’ll also inspect the app lifecycle methods, particularly `onOpenURL` and relevant scene delegates to ensure efficiency. Using tools for parallel reading will help streamline the process.
**Managing todos and updates**

I need to manage todos and provide status updates, which will require some code changes. I'm planning to create a todo list that includes items like adding a file import handler in the app entry, saving files to the Uploads directory, and showing an alert for users to refresh and import files. I'll also look into handling iOS 26 document capabilities and ensure the Info.plist declares supported file types like .txt and .epub. I’ll use the multi_tool_use.parallel to read multiple related files for efficiency.</details></think>

我先查看应用入口和上传目录的实现，以及 Info.plist 是否已声明可打开的文件类型，接着会在应用层添加外部文件打开处理逻辑，将文件保存到 Uploads 目录，并弹出提示指引用户刷新后导入。现在开始读取相关文件。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering alert implementation**

I’m thinking that the simplest solution is to store a `@Published var` called "recentlySavedUploadFileName" in the central app state and display a toast on the root view. Alternatively, I could post a custom notification via NotificationCenter for the AppSettingsView to listen to. However, using SwiftUI’s `.onOpenURL` in the BookReaderApp seems even simpler. I could copy the file and show a transient alert using a State variable. I’ll need to check the BookReaderApp.swift file for its structure and existing alert implementations.
**Planning URL handling**

I'm considering adding an `UIApplicationDelegate` adaptor and using the `.onOpenURL` modifier, which allows us to handle URLs. I’ll implement the handler to start accessing the security scope if necessary, especially since the URL comes from "Documents/Inbox" when the app opens via "Open in." 

We might not need security scoping for `UIDocumentInteraction`, as the file path stays accessible, but with iOS 26's changes in security, I should call `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource` just in case. 

I also need to determine allowed file types, like plain text, and possibly zip files. Plus, I’ll figure out whether to copy or move the files we handle.
**Managing file uploads**

I’m thinking the Inbox file shouldn’t be modified, but instead, we can move or copy it to the Uploads directory using a unique filename function similar to `WebUploadServer.uniqueDestinationURL`. If that function is private, I might need to create my own or refactor it to be public. One easy way is to call `WebUploadServer.shared.uploadsDirectory()` to build the destination URL, appending an index if it already exists.

After copying, I need to consider whether to remove the original. Apple says you must move or copy when accessing from Inbox, but it might be safer just to leave it for now, since the system cleans up automatically.

I’ll set a `@State var` for 'externalOpenAlertMessage' to show an alert indicating the file was saved to Uploads. I’ll use Localizable strings for translations, adding keys like `external_open.saved_to_uploads` and `external_open.failed` to the `Localizable.strings` for both English and simplified Chinese.
**Updating repository details**

I’ll add a safe placeholder message as I edit the repository, ensuring that the Info.plist contains `CFBundleDocumentTypes` with `LSItemContentTypes` set to `public.plain-text` for iOS 14+.  I should also include `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` as true, although it may not be required, and set the `CFBundleTypeRole` to 'Viewer'.

Next, I’ll make sure "Supports iTunes file sharing" is set to true with `UIFileSharingEnabled`, which might not be necessary either.

For the user requirement, I’ll show an alert with an actionable button that says "去设置" to direct them to the AppSettingsView. Since navigation from the root hasn’t loaded yet, we might post a Notification to open the Settings screen, but I’ll avoid restructuring navigation. Instead, I’ll keep it simple and show an alert text with instructions.
**Implementing file handling and localization**

I need to ensure compatibility with iOS 26 regarding security, so I’ll call `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource`. In the `NovelReaderApp`, I'll create a `@State private var` for the external alert and a success flag.

I'll implement the `handleOpenedURL` function to copy files in the background using `FileManager`. The file size, particularly for .txt, may be large, but I'll use `DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async` for the operation.

I'll check the file name, validate extensions for .txt or .text, and use an alert to notify users about saving requirements. To maintain organization, I’ll manage file paths and ensure proper messaging, including localized strings for alerts. 

I also plan to modify the Info.plist file to include necessary keys for document types and support. I'll verify my code style and organization throughout, ensuring everything remains consistent, especially in localization files. Additionally, it seems I’ll need a helper function for `withSecurityScopedAccess`, and I’ll make sure to prepare for commit messages as well.
**Setting up the todo list for tasks**

According to the "todo_spec," for medium-to-large tasks, I need to create a todo list. Since this involves multiple steps across files, I’ll use `todo_write` to keep track of tasks. 

I plan to add document type handlers to the Info.plist, implement external file opening in the app to save to Uploads with a notification message, and add the necessary localized strings.

I’ll begin by updating the todo list to "in_progress" before starting any edits. After that, I’ll use `todo_write merge=false` to create the tasks list. I’ll then make edits to the Info.plist, BookReaderApp.swift, and the zh-Hans and en Localizable.strings files. I’ll also run `read_lints` on the changed files to check for any issues. Finally, I need to ensure I preserve style and quotes in the Localizable.strings files.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering file upload logic**

I'm realizing that if the server hasn't been started, the initialization process won't run either. We'll need to call `WebUploadServer.shared` to trigger the initialization, which will create the necessary directory. Then I’ll compute the destination path using a unique naming function. I'll copy the file while checking if it already exists to avoid overwriting. Oh, and I should consider how to handle iCloud files that might not be downloaded yet. After copying, I'll update the alert for the user about the saved file.
**Implementing URL support and localization**

I see that I need to address multi-URL support, but `.onOpenURL` only handles one URL, so I’m not sure how to extend that. I considered using `onContinueUserActivity` for NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb, but it may not be necessary. Next, I'll focus on implementing code changes using `apply_patch`. The tool suggests reading the file again if it's been more than five messages since we last read it. I’ll work on patches for both the Info.plist and BookReaderApp.swift, and I need to check the localization files for proper formatting to add new strings.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing file opening feature**

I'm looking at implementing a feature to allow opening third-party files through the app. The plan is to save these files to the Uploads directory and prompt the user to refresh their files in the system before importing. I’ve noted that we need to handle document types in Info.plist and adjust our app to manage open URL scenes. Since we're using SwiftUI, I should explore using `.onOpenURL` for file handling. Also, we'll need to set CFBundleDocumentTypes for proper document support.
**Configuring document support in iOS**

To allow the app to receive files via "Copy to App," I need to enable document types and set `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` to true for in-place editing. However, since I want to copy files into the Uploads directory, I should get the URL from the App's Documents/Inbox through UIDocumentInteraction's "Open in" path.

In a SwiftUI app, I can use `UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor` to implement the method `application(_:open:options:)`. I should remember to also add `UIFileSharingEnabled` and configure `CFBundleDocumentTypes` to include document types like `public.plain-text` and `com.apple.iwork.pages`.
**Setting up file type and user alerts**

The goal is to configure the app to handle only text files, so I'll set it to support both `public.plain-text` and `public.text`. Also, I need to add localized strings for messages indicating that files have been saved to the Uploads directory, telling users to refresh in settings before importing. 

When users open files from the share sheet, the app will launch into the specified window. I can use `@Published` events in `WebUploadServer` or handle alert messages directly in the app. Notifications can be posted when files are imported, and the `AppSettingsView` can show alerts accordingly.
**Implementing file saved notifications**

In the `AppSettingsView`, there's already a `.toast` feature using `alertMessage`. I can enhance this by adding an `.onReceive` to listen for a custom notification, specifically for "external file saved," which will update the alert message. 

I'll create a new notification name called `.externalFileSaved` and ensure `AppSettingsView` subscribes to it through the NotificationCenter's default publisher. 

Next, I’ll add string keys for localization, update the Info.plist with the necessary document types, and confirm the `uploadsDirectory()` method is in `WebUploadServer` to manage file placements.
**Implementing file saved notifications and alerts**

I'll add a method to respond to the external file saved notification by using `.onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .externalFileSaved))` to set the message based on user info. This will trigger an alert similar to the existing `db.init_error` alert. 

SwiftUI can handle multiple alerts in the same view, so I can implement an additional alert for displaying the `externalOpenMessage`. I'll also localize the title for the alert and ensure the user is prompted to refresh the upload list. My next steps involve running necessary edits using `apply_patch`, updating Info.plist, and ensuring code formatting remains consistent.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Continuing implementation tasks**

I need to keep going with the implementation. The user wants third-party files to open with the app, save to Uploads, and prompt the user to refresh uploaded files and import. We've added some elements, like the Info.plist document types and the onOpenURL handler, but we haven't created the user-visible prompt yet. I also see that we need to add localized strings for external openings. Uh-oh, it looks like I made an error with the patch for localizations! We need to establish new keys to handle this properly.
**Streamlining alert functionality**

Right now, the app uses `alertMessage` in AppSettingsView to show toasts, but I need a global way to display messages. I'll create an `@State` in `NovelReaderApp` for external messages, which can trigger an alert or overlay. Currently, there's an alert for initialization errors, so I could add another for external imports. However, AlertToast is limited to AppSettingsView. Instead, using `@State private var externalImportMessage: String?` and presenting an alert makes sense. It seems I can only use one alert per view in iOS 17, though!
**Implementing alert improvements**

I can add another alert using `.alert(String, isPresented:)`, although having multiple alerts on the same view can be tricky. Another option is to reuse the existing alert in a ZStack, but an easier approach could be to create a small overlay styled as a Toast. However, sticking with a system alert feels more straightforward. 

I'll check BookReaderApp.swift, where the current alert is linked to the `BookListView` chain. I plan to add a new state variable for external alerts, ensuring consistency throughout the app.
**Adding localized keys**

I’m working on adding localized keys for alerts. Specifically, I want to create keys for messages about saved files, including the title and message for when a file is saved to Uploads. If I include the filename, I can format it with %@ for the message. So, I'll make a message like, "Saved “%@” to Uploads. Go to Settings - Web Upload, tap Refresh then Import." 

After handling the open URL, I plan to set `externalOpenAlert` with this formatted string and possibly navigate to settings as needed. There are a couple of edge cases to consider, but that should be manageable.
**Modifying handleOpenURL and commits**

I’ll adjust the `handleOpenURL` function and make sure to call `WebUploadServer.shared.refreshUploadedFiles()` to refresh the uploaded files when the user goes to settings. I need to implement a new `@State private var externalOpenTip: String?` and add an `.alert` around the top-level view, then update the localization keys for zh-Hans and English strings accordingly.

Regarding commits, since the user didn't include "@Commit," I won’t generate a commit message. However, there’s a bug in the Info.plist where the key for `CFBundleDocumentTypes` used `<Array>` instead of `<array>`. I'll need to fix that, confirming all details are correct.</details></think>

I see there’s an error in Info.plist due to an unknown tag: it’s using <Array> with a capital 'A' when it should be <array>. I'll also need to check the closing tag to make sure it's </array>.

After that, I need to summarize the changes and consider proposing a Git commit. There's a rule about generating a Chinese Git commit message, but it doesn't trigger automatically. Also, I have memories of @Commit for auto-commit, but I won’t go that route. I'll just focus on fixing things.</details></think>

我看到了 Info.plist 的 XML 标签大小写问题导致解析失败。我现在把 `Array` 修正为正确的 `array` 标签，然后你可以重新构建。

- 已将 `Info.plist` 的 `Array` 标签修正为正确的小写 `array`，并保持其它结构不变。
- 请重新构建运行，若还有报错我再继续排查。
