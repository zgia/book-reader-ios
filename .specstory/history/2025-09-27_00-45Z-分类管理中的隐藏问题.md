<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing category filter bug**

I need to fix a bug in the BookListView menu where hidden or deleted categories still appear after returning from CategoryView. The menu dynamically builds from `db.fetchCategories(includeHidden: false)`, but this fetch might not update when the view is loaded. I need to consider if there's a need to refresh categories when changes occur. Currently, I don’t have an observer for category changes. This could mean that `selectedCategoryId` is still pointing to an invalid category.
**Clarifying the loadBooks logic**

The `loadBooks` function checks for visible categories using `db.fetchCategories(includeHidden: false)` and sets `selectedCategoryId` to nil if it's not in those categories. I need to consider when `loadBooks` is called: onAppear, when the search text changes, or when a category is selected. When returning from CategoryView, it triggers `onAppear` again since it’s a NavigationLink. However, the menu built in the toolbar uses `db.fetchCategories`, but the Menu content doesn’t update unless there's a triggering event.
**Understanding the view update issue**

When returning, the `List` calls `loadBooks` in onAppear to update, but if `selectedCategoryId` references a deleted or hidden category, it correctly resets to nil. However, users report that a hidden/deleted category, B, still shows in the menu. This suggests that `db.fetchCategories(includeHidden: false)` might still include B due to the view not updating the `db` state. Even though `fetchCategories` should reflect DB changes, the `Menu` might only update upon reopening, which isn't happening here.
**Investigating the menu visibility issue**

The `cats` constant in the `Menu` closure should re-fetch categories with each recompute. However, if no state changes, the re-render may not happen. When returning to the list, `onAppear` sets `books`, which should trigger a state change and cause the `Menu` to update. But the bug might be that `onAppear` isn't called because the BookListView remains in the stack. Although it’s usually triggered, mine is tied to the `List` within the `NavigationStack`, which could explain why the user still sees category B until the app is restarted.
**Examining category filtering**

Another angle I’m considering is that category "B" is set to hidden, yet it still appears in the menu despite us calling `includeHidden: false`. This suggests that we're not filtering hidden categories correctly. The code is meant to fetch categories using `cats = db.fetchCategories(includeHidden: false)` each time, but maybe it’s returning cached data that isn't being updated after modifications in CategoryView. I think I need to inspect DatabaseManager.swift and Repositories.swift to see if notifications or a `@Published` categories list are necessary.</details></think>

我先快速定位分类数据的来源与刷新机制，检查 `DatabaseManager.fetchCategories` 的实现，以及分类视图对分类隐藏/删除后的更新是否会通知或影响书籍列表界面的刷新。随后我会根据结果在 `BookListView` 增加一个分类变更的监听或刷新逻辑，确保返回后菜单不再显示被隐藏/删除的分类。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing category refresh bug**

I need to address a bug where, after selecting category A and deleting/hiding category B in the Category management view, B still shows in the BookListView. This happens because the menu in BookListView fetches categories from the database without refreshing when navigating back. The issue seems to stem from SwiftUI reusing views without recomputing. While the `onAppear` of BookListView triggers loading books, it doesn't refresh the category list, even though categories are dynamic. The database is an `ObservableObject`, so I need to ensure it reflects changes properly.
**Addressing Menu refresh issue**

I've figured out that only `@Published` properties can make SwiftUI observe view updates. The `fetchCategories` function pulls data from the database, but if the BookListView isn’t invalidated, the Menu content could be cached. When navigating back, `.onAppear` should trigger again, but since `cats` may be captured as a constant within the Menu, it won't recompute unless the view is invalidated. I suspect the `DatabaseManager` might not be publishing changes for category updates, causing the refresh issue. When returning, the categories should update, but they rely on `@State` changes for triggering the view to refresh properly.
**Investigating category visibility issue**

The issue is that category B remains visible in the user interface, indicating that the `includeHidden: false` isn’t filtering out hidden categories properly, even though `fetchCategories` should filter by `ishidden=0`. The bug happens after hiding or deleting B, yet it still appears in the BookListView's menu. This might be because the `CategoryView` was pushed onto the same `NavigationStack`, causing the menu content to cache. The menu’s dynamic entries are created when the menu opens, and they should fetch the latest data when the body renders. However, if `db.fetchCategories` is querying from a held `dbQueue`, the changes may not refresh the view immediately.
**Examining menu refresh on return**

I’m considering that the `db` environment object stays the same, and no state change is triggering a re-render. The menu uses a local assignment of `let cats = db.fetchCategories(includeHidden: false)`, which isn't tied to any `@Published` properties. SwiftUI usually re-evaluates when there's a state change. Returning from `CategoryView` might trigger `loadBooks`, updating the `books` state, but it seems category B still appears. The `onAppear` method for `BookListView` might not be called on returning since it's still in the stack, which could lead to stale menu content.
**Planning notification for category updates**

It seems the `.onAppear` method is attached to the inner `NavigationStack`, which is why it doesn't trigger again when returning from `CategoryView`. Since the `NavigationStack` remains, the menu's categories get stale. To fix this, I can implement a publisher/notification from `DatabaseManager` when categories change, or use a new notification name for category updates. I'll add `Notification.Name` for `.categoriesDidChange`, post notifications after any updates in `DatabaseManager`, and listen for these notifications in `BookListView` to refine the UI. This will let us increment a state variable or force updates seamlessly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing category bug**

I need to address a bug where the category B still appears after being hidden or deleted. It seems like in BookListView, the menu dynamically builds categories using `db.fetchCategories(includeHidden: false)`, but this is evaluated just once. In SwiftUI, the menu content should rebuild on refresh, but maybe BookListView isn't refreshing categories when returning from CategoryView. The `OnAppear` function refetches books but might not trigger a re-render for the menu. I'll need to check that.
**Addressing view refresh issue**

I need to investigate the BookListView, which uses a NavigationStack and pushes CategoryView. When returning, SwiftUI should call `onAppear`, but maybe it doesn't. Usually, popping should trigger the parent view's `onAppear`, but sometimes it doesn't if it's still visible. Additionally, NotificationCenter only listens for `dismissAllModals`, not category changes. When updating or deleting a category in CategoryView, there's no notification sent to BookListView. I should establish a `Notification.Name` for category changes to help refresh BookListView accordingly.
**Rebuilding menu on category changes**

Since BookListView ignores hidden categories and resets `selectedCategoryId`, I need to ensure `loadBooks` is called and the menu rebuilds. To trigger the rebuild, I could add a `@State` variable like `categoriesVersion = 0` in BookListView, which I would reference in the menu content closure. On a notification, I'd increment `categoriesVersion` and call `loadBooks`. However, simply calling `loadBooks` might not update the menu, especially if the category change doesn’t affect the books list. Hiding or deleting a category can change the category list without impacting the books themselves.
**Ensuring state updates**

If `selectedCategoryId` stays as A, calling `loadBooks` will fetch books for A, which means the books list remains unchanged. SwiftUI might not trigger a state change if the content is identical, even if I set books to the same value. It’s possible that SwiftUI doesn't see this as a change due to how it tracks `@State` properties. To be safer, it makes sense to create a version state for categories or possibly rely on `@EnvironmentObject` with notifications for category changes. Adding a `categoriesDidChange` notification could be a solid solution.
**Managing category notifications**

I need to have CategoryView post a notification to `NotificationCenter` (categoriesDidChange) whenever operations like updating, deleting, or inserting categories occur. It makes sense to call this post after modifications. In BookListView, I'll attach `onReceive` to listen for this notification to call `loadBooks` and update a state variable for a refresh. I should ensure to reset `selectedCategoryId` if a category is removed or hidden. I’ll also implement a versioning system with a `categoriesVersion` state variable to help force re-renders as needed, particularly in the menu. Let's confirm these changes in the relevant files!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Revising category updates**

I'm noticing that the code computes `visibleCategories` properly, but if the `selectedCategoryId` isn't present, it sets it to nil, which is good. However, it looks like they're re-fetching categories too often, using `let cats = db.fetchCategories(...)` each time. I think it would be better to reference the `categories` state variable to create dynamic items; this way, the UI updates with any changes. 

I'll also edit the necessary files to ensure notifications are posted after category operations.
**Updating category handling**

I’m considering how to ensure that updates happen safely on the main thread for the UI. I’ll make a few edits to `BookListView.swift`. First, I need to add a `@State` property for categories and replace the existing fetch logic with this state variable to enhance reactivity.

In the `onAppear` method, I’ll make sure to fetch the categories. Also, I plan to add an observer for notification changes, updating categories as needed and maintaining the current selected category. It’s good that I already have `Foundation` imported for `Notification.Name`.
**Preparing for code changes**

I need to declare the static property `categoriesDidChange` in the `BookReaderApp.swift` extension, while adhering to the four-space indentation style. After making the code edits, I should run the `read_lints` to check for linting errors since the environment might not provide a linter directly. It sounds like I can run it on the files that I changed.

There’s also a requirement for a Chinese conventional commit message due to workspace rules, but the user's message doesn’t include the `@Commit` tag. This situation feels a bit ambiguous!
**Clarifying commit message protocol**

It seems that we must ensure each commit message adheres to specific guidelines, but we only need to generate a commit when it’s explicitly requested. The developer instructions mentioned that we can run commands but didn’t ask for an auto-commit, so I won’t do that unless instructed.

Additionally, I need to maintain a "status_update" note for tool calls, just like before. I’ll make edits to three files and follow the guidelines by using `apply_patch`. I can also refer back to `BookListView.swift` since it’s still relevant from earlier interactions.
**Preparing to apply patches safely**

I realize that for safe patching, I need to ensure I've read the `BookListView.swift` file with the `read_file` tool since I haven't explicitly done this recently. Although it’s in the attached files, the rules are strict. So, I’ll call `read_file` on that now along with the other necessary steps.

Once I finish reading, I’ll apply patches to three files and run `read_lints` afterward. I'll create a to-do list to manage the tasks, make a status update before edits, and finally provide a summary after completing everything.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing category updates**

I’m thinking about how to handle the category updates in the code. After inserting a new category, I want to ensure that BookListView refreshes and the categories list updates accordingly. I’ll need to use todo_write to create tasks since this is a multi-step edit across files.

I’ll implement some modifications in several files, focusing on maintaining clean code style while adding necessary notifications in the notification system.
**Ensuring code compliance**

I need to make sure there are no linter errors in the changed files, so I'll use read_lints. There's this requirement about commit messages in Chinese in the workspace rules, but since the user didn't use "@Commit," I won’t commit anything.

It's a bit ambiguous regarding when to generate that message, but I’ll stick to the rule that we only commit when asked. I'll focus on implementing the necessary changes and building a TODO list to keep track of my tasks.
**Implementing notification updates**

I’m ensuring the notification system works in real time. If the CategoryView loads with included hidden categories, it should trigger notifications when toggling changes. So, I'll proceed with the necessary tool calls and create a clear list of tasks.

First, I’ll add a categoriesDidChange notification type, emit notifications in the DatabaseManager category mutations, and then listen in BookListView to refresh upon receiving notifications.

I'll also verify everything by checking for lints while I make these edits. Let's get started!
**Updating category functions**

I’ll make sure to incorporate the category updates in functions like updateCategoryTitle, updateCategoryHidden, and deleteCategory. This will involve ensuring optional sorts are accounted for.

In BookListView.swift, I need to add an .onReceive for the .categoriesDidChange notification. I’ll attach this to the NavigationStack, similar to how we handle .onAppear, to trigger loading books when that change occurs. 

I don’t need to import Combine for this since SwiftUI already includes it, but I’ll double-check the indentation style and run read_lints after making these edits. Let's proceed!</details></think>

我将创建待办来跟踪修复步骤，然后实现通知机制：在 `Notification.Name` 中新增 `categoriesDidChange`，在分类的新增/修改/隐藏/删除处发送该通知，并在 `BookListView` 订阅该通知以刷新列表和菜单。接下来我会进行这些代码编辑并自检。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging view updates**

I'm analyzing how the menu categories are built and updating. It seems the view isn't re-rendering as expected when categories are hidden or deleted. After selecting a category, it appears the menu content isn’t reflecting the changes correctly. The database updates but maybe the view tree doesn’t get recomputed in time. When the user says, "回到图书列表，这时菜单项还能看到B," it suggests that the menu isn't refreshing until it's reopened, which could be the core issue.
**Examining menu updates**

It looks like the menu only shows an icon, and the item list is built from a variable that doesn't reevaluate unless the view changes. The database doesn't have a published property for categories, so even if we trigger `loadBooks` to update the state, it might not refresh the menu if the books remain unchanged. For example, hiding or deleting categories won't affect the book list, so the list could stay the same, preventing SwiftUI from detecting any changes.
**Triggering menu updates**

The menu content might stay the same, so I need to think about how to trigger an update for the categories list. One approach could be posting a `categoriesDidChange` notification in `CategoryView` after updates. Then `BookListView` can listen for this notification and, if the `selectedCategoryId` is hidden or deleted, set it to nil. They already manage visible categories with `loadBooks`, but I'll need to ensure it also reacts to category changes. Toggling a `categoriesVersion` might also help trigger a re-render if needed.
**Implementing state updates**

To ensure the view updates properly, I can set a simple state variable to trigger it. It may even be possible to make `selectedCategoryId` set to itself, but that feels a bit hacky. A better solution would be to keep an `@Published` categories list in `DatabaseManager`, so updates automatically notify the environment. Meanwhile, posting notifications and using an `onReceive` for `.categoriesDidChange` could maintain a counter that helps to call `loadBooks`. Adding a `@State private var categoryVersion` could be a solid way to ensure re-rendering in the menu.
**Updating category notifications**

To refresh `BookListView`, I plan to post a notification in the `DatabaseManager` methods after updating categories. This means that whenever I insert, update, or delete categories, I’ll send a `.categoriesDidChange` notification. In `BookListView`, I can handle this with an `.onReceive` that increments a `@State` variable called `categoriesVersion` and calls `loadBooks`. I'll ensure to use `.id(categoriesVersion)` to make the menu re-compute correctly, ensuring that any changes are reflected in the UI. I must pay attention to the syntax to avoid errors while implementing these changes.
**Applying updates and notifications**

I can add the `.id(categoriesVersion)` modifier right after the `Menu` expression because they're using a trailing closure. I'll need to insert a new line after line 102 for this. Also, I'll define a new state variable as `@State private var categoriesVersion: Int = 0`, placing it near other state variables. Adding an `.onReceive` after existing modifiers like `.onDisappear` is important to ensure the categories update properly when notified. For Git, since the user didn’t include `@Commit`, I won't auto-commit but will prepare the changes and suggest a commit.</details></think>

我将添加分类变更的通知并在相关位置触发，同时在 `BookListView` 监听该通知，使用一个版本计数触发菜单刷新，并调用 `loadBooks`。接着我会检查可能的语法/格式问题。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reapplying patch to code**

I need to revisit the patch for BookListView.swift to make sure the context order is correct. We previously identified necessary changes, like adding @State var categoriesVersion, and the .onReceive handler, but the apply_patch failed due to hunks ordering. I’ll read the file again for accuracy. We also have TODOs to manage, including marking tasks as completed. After reviewing Notification.Name.categoriesDidChange, it's time to focus on adding listeners in BookListView. I need to ensure proper indentation and consider importing Combine.
**Updating Menu in SwiftUI**

I don't need any extra imports. I should add @State categoriesVersion: Int = 0 in the struct, close to other states. It seems I need to use .onReceive(...) after .onDisappear or within the NavigationStack list view modifiers. I want to ensure I attach this correctly to the outermost view. Earlier, we tried placing .id(categoriesVersion) on the Menu label's Image, but it’s better to attach it to the Menu view itself or the ToolbarItem content for proper refreshing. It's essential that this change goes after the Menu view builder closure for it to work.
**Modifying Menu in ToolbarItem**

The current code sets up a ToolbarItem with a Menu and an Image. I can add .id(categoriesVersion) right after the Menu view, which is fine to do. This change would look like this: The Menu label would include the image, followed by the .id modification. 

For the .onReceive of .categoriesDidChange, we want to ensure it resets selectedCategoryId if a hidden or deleted category is missing. However, loadBooks already handles that, which is good. The BookListView’s Menu uses db.fetchCategories to get current categories, ensuring that if the menu is reconstructed, it fetches updated categories, avoiding stale content.
**Handling category updates**

I need to manage the situation where a newly added category doesn't immediately show up. When the categoriesDidChange event fires on insertCategory, the Menu's refresh with .id will reflect that change. We might also need to reload the list by calling loadBooks(search: searchText) to include the new category. Although the book list only displays books, users may expect the category menu to show the new category instantly. 

Currently, CategoryView calls load() after database changes but doesn't notify. I’ve added notifications in DatabaseManager, so now I’ll implement the patch. I also added a Notification.Name extension in BookReaderApp.swift for consistent notification definitions. I’ll run lints on modified files and update TODOs accordingly.
**Processing Git commit rules**

The user's rules about generating Git commit messages apply only when the message contains @Commit, which it didn't in this case, so no commit will happen. They want expert iOS development, and I feel confident about that based on my actions. I need to make sure to include a status update before any tool invocations, which I did previously. Now, I’ll proceed by running read_file for BookListView.swift and patch it as needed.</details></think>

我刚刚把全局通知名新增好了，并在分类的新增/改名/隐藏/删除/给书变更分类时广播分类变更；现在我会更新 `BookListView.swift`：加一个版本计数状态，订阅分类变更通知后刷新数据，并给分类菜单加 `.id(categoriesVersion)` 强制重建。随后我会运行一次静态检查。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing Category Bug Fix**

I need to address the bug fix related to category changes in CategoryView. When switching back to BookListView, the old categories still appear. We initially tried adding a categoriesDidChange observer to BookListView and updating the Category operations notifications. While the previous patches, like adding Notification.Name.categoriesDidChange and modifying Repositories.swift to post updates, worked, the changes to BookListView.swift didn't stick. I must reapply the correct changes, including adding a state for categoriesVersion and setting up onReceive for notifications to refresh the menu.
**Integrating Category Updates**

I’m considering a straightforward method involving `loadBooks` and `selectedCategoryId` to ensure the menu reflects any new categories dynamically. If the Menu closure re-executes during state changes, it will show the updated categories. To facilitate this, I’ll add a state variable, `categoriesVersion`, that will be used in `.id` to trigger a re-creation. I plan to add `@State private var categoriesVersion: Int = 0` and implement an observer for category changes. This way, the menu should refresh correctly.
**Modifying Menu and Todos**

I need to pinpoint the exact code to change. The menu is defined from lines 67 to 103, and at line 100, I can add `.id(categoriesVersion)` right after the `}` of the `Menu`, before closing the `ToolbarItem`. This change requires defining the `categoriesVersion` property. After that, I need to update the status of our todo list, marking completed tasks and running lint checks on the modified files: BookReaderApp.swift, Repositories.swift, and BookListView.swift. I’ll also consider importing Combine for the NotificationCenter publisher in SwiftUI.</details></think>

我刚完成了通知名定义和数据库层的广播。现在我会编辑 `BookListView.swift`：新增 `categoriesVersion` 状态、订阅分类变更通知触发 `loadBooks`，并给 `Menu` 添加 `.id(categoriesVersion)` 以强制重建，随后我会运行一次静态检查。

## Todo List

- [x] 新增 Notification.Name.categoriesDidChange
- [x] 在 DatabaseManager 的分类写操作中发送 categoriesDidChange
- [x] 在 BookListView 订阅 categoriesDidChange 并调用 loadBooks
- [x] 运行代码检查以确保无linter错误

---

- 我已在全局添加 `Notification.Name.categoriesDidChange`，并在分类的新增、改名、隐藏、删除、以及书籍变更分类时广播该通知。
- 在 `BookListView` 中新增 `categoriesVersion` 状态，订阅分类变更通知后自增此值并调用 `loadBooks`，同时给分类 `Menu` 添加 `.id(categoriesVersion)`，确保菜单立即重建、隐藏/删除/新增分类即时生效。
- 运行静态检查通过。

你现在在分类管理中新增/隐藏/删除后，回到图书列表应立即看到菜单变化，新增分类也会立刻出现。
