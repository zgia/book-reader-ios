# Optimize app performance for reading (2025-10-04 04:19Z)

_**User (2025-10-04 01:18Z)**_

@ReaderView.swift 第一次运行app，阅读某本书，进入第一章时，页面会卡顿1~2秒，屏幕一半是设置的背景色，另一半是白色，请检查代码，看看哪里可以优化的地方。比如可以加上日志，看看哪个处理逻辑比较耗时。可以使用LogCategory区分不同的日志

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Searching for log definitions**

I think I need to search the file for the definitions related to Log usage and LogCategory. I noticed that `Log.debug` is being used, so I should see where Log is defined. It’s likely to be in the Utils/DebugUtils.swift file. So, the next step is to open that file and take a closer look at its content. This will help me understand how logging is implemented.</details></think>

---

我先快速定位并审阅与日志相关的工具与当前阅读逻辑的关键路径，然后并行打开 `DebugUtils.swift` 与 `Paginator.swift` 以判断是否已有 `LogCategory` 或可复用的计时工具，并在 `ReaderView.swift` 中加入分段性能日志（DB读取、段落处理、分页、UI首次渲染、预取、相邻章节计算等）的埋点。接着我会实施必要的代码编辑来添加这些日志和轻量优化。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering log modifications**

I think we need to update DebugUtils.swift to add new log categories like pagination, reader, and performance. Right now, we have general categories like network, UI, and database. The user mentioned using LogCategory to differentiate logs, which we can definitely enhance. We can also incorporate micro-optimizations, like making page calculations faster. However, I’ll avoid any major refactoring — just adding logs and minimizing heavy UI actions during the initial draw sounds right. Plus, we have to maintain the correct styles and follow instructions for multi-step tasks.
**Planning instrumentation tasks**

I need to wrap my head around this multi-step instrumentation across files. I’ll create TODO items like adding LogCategory cases, timing for ReaderView.loadContent, and Paginator.paginate. It seems I should also instrument the prefetch, swipe actions, and UI onAppear. The issue with the background whiteness could stem from ScrollView’s default white background. So, I’m thinking of adding `.background(reading.backgroundColor)` to both the ScrollView in contentScrollView and the previews to remedy that half-white look. Plus, we can use `os_signpost` for duration measurements and add a timing helper to DebugUtils.
**Exploring timing solutions**

I’m considering how to handle concurrency with async tasks. A good idea might be to create a TimerGuard struct that captures the start time and logs when it deinitializes. Alternatively, a TimeTracer for manual logging could work, but the simplest approach might be just capturing the start time with `let t0 = Date();` then doing the computation, and afterward, I can log the elapsed time with either the `.reader` or `.pagination` category. Adding those categories sounds like a solid plan!
**Planning instrumentation points**

I’m outlining where to add instrumentation for logging purposes. For `loadContent(for:)`, I can log the start time before dispatching to the background and time various processes like database fetching, processing paragraphs, and pagination. The same instrumentation can apply to `ensurePrepared(for:completion:)` during background fetch and pagination. 

I should log chapter numbers in `prefetchAroundCurrent` and document actions in `navigateToAdjacentChapter`. Also, the synchronous timing for restoring `LastProgress` in `onAppear` might not be too heavy. For `Paginator.paginate`, I want to log attributes like length and screen settings, and I might need to import the appropriate logging libraries.
**Implementing logging improvements**

I need to make some improvements related to logging and background handling. First off, I’ll import Foundation for the necessary modules. I realized using Log doesn’t actually require os since it's covered in DebugUtils. When loading content for the current book, I need to consider that pagination can be heavy. 

So, I’ll implement asynchronous pagination and add log categories like reader and pagination. For ScrollViews, I’ll update their background to avoid any white halves showing. I’ll also craft TODOs for these performance logs and modifications in DebugUtils, Paginator, and ReaderView. After that, we'll verify everything compiles correctly!</details></think>

我将先创建分阶段的待办来跟踪：1) 扩展 LogCategory；2) 在 ReaderView 中为关键路径添加耗时日志；3) 在 Paginator 中添加分页耗时日志；4) 修正 ScrollView 背景避免白色闪屏。接下来我会同时编辑 `DebugUtils.swift`, `ReaderView.swift`, `Paginator.swift`。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning code improvements**

I need to implement logging and address the issue of the white background on half-screen. The user has asked to check the code for the addition of logs with distinct LogCategories and look for optimization points. This means I should focus on adding instrumentation around heavy operations such as DB reads, processing paragraphs, pagination, and others. I'll also make sure to fix the background issue caused by the transparent ScrollView. I'm thinking about using a timing helper for better performance insights.
**Analyzing ScrollView background issues**

I’m considering the ScrollView potentially overlaying the full screen with a white background, possibly due to the default clear background of Text. During geometry initialization, if the screen size is zero, that might lead to oversized characters and large lines per page. The white half is likely an issue with iOS 18/19. To ensure consistency, I should set the background color on the ScrollView and consider ignoring the safe area. Also, I need to address loading views that might appear before pages are ready, causing unexpected white areas.
**Implementing logging and timing**

We already have the background set at the root, so I can apply `reading.backgroundColor` to the `ScrollView` and its preview as well. Next, I'll add instrumentation, starting with extending the LogCategory enum to include `reader` and `pagination`, while ensuring we don't break existing conventions. 

I also want to create a timing utility, perhaps a `PerfTimer` struct. This will use `DispatchTime` to measure elapsed time and log it appropriately. I must keep an eye on maintaining the file's indentation, which seems to be 4 spaces in DebugUtils.swift.
**Enhancing logging in pagination**

I need to implement logging in the `Paginator.paginate` method, both before and after computing to capture text length, page count, and elapsed time. In `ReaderView.swift`, I want to time specific actions: for instance, during a cache miss in `loadContent(for:)`, I'll measure the DB read and processing times.

Similar timing should be applied to `ensurePrepared`, and I might also want to measure during `prefetchAroundCurrent`. For `navigateToAdjacentChapter`, I’ll consider logging the time for the `ensurePrepared` path. 

Additionally, while I can start logging in `onAppear`, I won’t be able to measure heavy workloads outside that. I'll also log the DB query time in `loadCurrentBook`. For the restore logic, I think it’s not necessary to add logs.

I’ll categorize my logs under `reader` for high-level flows, `database` for DB reads, `pagination` for pagination actions, and `prefetch` for prefetching tasks. Additionally, precomputing pages in the background might help us show skeletons quickly before the entire text loads, especially if heavy text processing is causing delays.
**Planning logging and optimization**

The user only asked for logging and optimization, so I need to stick to minor changes and avoid major implementations. I can suggest potential optimizations later. For instance, when `pages` are assigned `computedPages`, we should add logging within `Paginator.paginate` to track text lengths, page counts, and elapsed time, without altering the heavy thread commits.

I’ll integrate the `PerfTimer` struct for timing various operations and ensure we capture the proper scope for our variables. I'll maintain the file formatting and apply any patches carefully while also setting the `.background(reading.backgroundColor)` for appropriate views.</details></think>

我将先扩展日志分类，然后在分页与阅读加载的关键路径添加耗时埋点，并为滚动视图补上背景色以避免白屏。接着我会实现这些编辑。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I attempted to patch ReaderView.swift, but it didn't work because the context didn't match. I have the full file content and need to find the snippet around .onAppear in the GeometryReader. I found the relevant details in lines 151-181, where there's a Log.debug call that uses a single argument. It seems the patch had a trailing comma, which caused the mismatch. I’ll recheck the file and apply the patch correctly while adding logs in other areas like loadContent and ensurePrepared.
I need to add a background color to the ScrollView to prevent it from showing that white half-screen issue. The app already uses reading.backgroundColor in the ZStack and top overlays, but it seems the ScrollView might still default to white. This could cause a mismatch where one side shows the background color while the other is white. My plan is to set .background(reading.backgroundColor) on the ScrollView and its content. I’m also thinking of hiding the default material for iOS 16+ if needed.
For the ScrollView, the default background is clear, which might be causing that white half-screen effect. It seems to relate to the root view's background and the geometry obtaining size initially. At app launch, screenSize starts at zero, and if it remains zero, geoSize can return negative values, impacting pagination. This might lead to either an enormous page or nothing at all. Alternatively, the white background could be a result of default OS behavior regarding safe areas during rendering. There's also a possibility of a delay caused by the loadContent function executing heavy operations in the background.
During the first run, it seems DatabaseManager.setupDatabase initializes the database, creating empty files and tables on the main thread. ReaderView also utilizes DatabaseManager.shared's dbQueue, where reading content happens in the background. The heavy writes during DB initialization could cause stuttering when opening the first chapter, leading to that 1-2 second freeze. The white half-screen likely appears because the content isn't ready yet, while performance logging with PerfTimer around key processes like database fetching and pagination could help identify issues. I’ll also ensure uniform background color in the ScrollViews and container.
I'm thinking about optimizing the ReaderView by prewarming the Paginator with a small text during its appearance to help with JIT compilation. I’ll implement PerfTimers in various places, such as in the onAppear function and loadContent method, to log performance metrics. I need to ensure I’m logging with the correct categories and adjusting the background colors to avoid that white half-screen issue. I’ll also preserve formatting in the file and use consistent indentation while adding the necessary logging and performance measurements throughout the code.
In the prefetchAroundCurrent function, I can log the number of chapters found for prefetching. Although adding a PerfTimer for "prefetchAroundCurrent" might not be strictly necessary since it already calls ensurePrepared, it could help identify any time-consuming logic. I'll still wrap it with a PerfTimer and log how many tasks are scheduled. Additionally, I’ll add .background(reading.backgroundColor) to the ScrollViews within contentScrollView and chapterContentView, along with their respective preview ScrollViews. I’ll implement these changes while also considering category logging for touchCurrentBookUpdatedAt, even if it might not be essential.</details></think>

我刚把日志分类扩展并添加了性能计时工具。现在我会在 `ReaderView` 中为 `onAppear`、`loadContent`、`ensurePrepared` 等关键路径加上详细的耗时日志，并为两个 ScrollView 设置背景色以避免白屏。随后我会检查代码风格与 lint。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Improving performance logging**

I'm planning to add performance logging across ReaderView, focusing on functions like loadContent and ensurePrepared. I notice there's a lag of 1-2 seconds when the first chapter loads, often with a half white screen. This could be due to intensive tasks such as database reads or paragraph processing. I've already incorporated PerfTimer and Paginator logging, but I'll also measure the time for data fetching and UI updates while ensuring ScrollViews don’t have a white background. Plus, I want to show loading progress instead of a blank screen.
**Implementing performance logging**

It looks like I'm using background(reading.backgroundColor) on ZStack, but the white background might be due to ScrollView defaults. I think adding a background to the ScrollViews should solve this issue. Also, I’m considering whether to turn off .animation for showControls, but that might not be necessary. Now, for logging: in loadContent(for: chapter), I’ll create a PerfTimer for the "loadContent" category, with granular timers for DB read, processing paragraphs, and pagination. I can use nested PerfTimers or simple timestamps to measure these durations.
**Enhancing caching and logging**

I want to log "cache hit" and a PerfTimer for "paginate cached" when necessary. In ensurePrepared(for:), I'll add PerfTimers around the database fetch, paragraph computation, and pagination, while also logging character counts and pages. In prefetchAroundCurrent, I might want to log the number of chapters prefetched. Additionally, I'm planning to add a background color to the contentScrollView and chapterContentView's ScrollView. Although adjusting DispatchQoS and enabling scroll bounce could be options, they don't seem essential right now. I'll also categorize logs and ensure my code is clean and concise during implementation.
**Applying patch modifications**

I'm planning to modify the contentScrollView by appending .background(reading.backgroundColor) to it. I’ll do the same for the preview ScrollView in chapterContentView. For loadContent(for:), I want to incorporate timers right at the beginning of the function, and possibly also in the cached path. Since it's complex, I'll use context markers while applying patches. For the contentScrollView, I’ll patch after the ScrollView block, likely around line 241, and then add .background after the .scrollIndicators in chapterContentView too.
**Instrumenting loadContent function**

I’m looking to instrument the loadContent function by adding performance logging. In the cached branch, I plan to compute pagination time before returning, so I'll include a PerfTimer for "paginate.cached" around the paginate call. For the non-cache path, I'll create a PerfTimer named "loadContent" before DispatchQueue.global to measure overall time. Inside the background queue, I’ll set up timers for DB reading, paragraph processing, and pagination. 

I’ll finish by logging messages and adding similar instrumentation to ensurePrepared(for:) and prefetchAroundCurrent. Adding backgrounds for ScrollViews should help eliminate the white flash too while I apply these patches!</details></think>

我将为 ReaderView 的关键函数与滚动视图添加耗时日志和背景色设置，并对预取与书籍加载增加日志。这将帮助定位卡顿点并避免白屏。接下来我会进行代码编辑。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Processing performance logs**

I need to instrument ReaderView.swift by adding performance logs and a background color to prevent that annoying white flash. The apply_patch failed due to context mismatches from prior changes, and now I’m trying to adjust several areas. To fix this, I should re-read the file for the current content and craft precise patch changes. I also need to follow the development process, updating todos while ensuring I integrate the background color in the ScrollView and chapterContentView.
**Addressing white background issues**

It seems like the user is encountering a white half-screen issue, which could be due to the default white background of the ScrollView. The ZStack's background is correct, but perhaps a geometry overlay is causing visual glitches. When first entering, SwiftUI might display the default scroll background as white before the container applies the desired color. Setting both the ScrollView and LazyVStack backgrounds to reading.backgroundColor could resolve this.

Also, I’ve noticed that while we have logging in place, many existing log calls are missing categories. The user wants to use LogCategory to distinguish these logs. Although adding categories to current log calls could be time-consuming, it’ll be necessary to meet their request.
**Enhancing logging and background colors**

I’ve decided we don't need to update all logs with categories, but we definitely need to add performance logging for specific functions like loadContent(for:), ensurePrepared(for:), prefetchAroundCurrent(), and loadCurrentBook(). OnAppear is already updated, but I should also consider measuring processParagraphs, adding a log for count/time there.

The code uses Log.debug with emojis, so I'll add PerfTimer wrappers as well. I might also want to address the background color issues in chapterContentView and LazyVStacks to prevent half-screen white visuals. Let’s review ReaderView.swift for precise patching!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing performance issues**

I need to tackle the user's request about the performance issue in the first chapter's load, where the screen shows half colored and half white. To diagnose this, I plan to add logs using LogCategory to pinpoint where time is spent. We've already implemented a new LogCategory, added a PerfTimer, and instrumented the Paginator. I've made attempts to add more logs in ReaderView, but there were some patch failures. I’ll ensure we instrument important methods and add background colors to avoid the white space.
**Identifying causes of performance issues**

I’m realizing that during the first load, empty pages can cause a default white background in the ScrollView if it isn't set. The outer background is applied to the geometry container, which should cover everything, but white could still peek through due to SafeArea or default settings on the initial render. I think applying the reading color to the inner ScrollView’s background could resolve this. 

There’s also the potential for heavy database queries upon first run, especially with the DatabaseManager creating an empty DB. I’ll keep an eye on the paginator’s algorithm and add PerfTimer logs as needed, since the splitting process in processParagraphs might be costly too. LazyVStack seems fine, though!
**Implementing screen geometry edits**

I'm thinking about how the screen size geometry is measured upon appearance. If the screen size is zero at the start, it might lead to pages with zero height, resulting in fewer pages. However, screenSize gets set to geo.size inside onAppear before calling loadContent, so that's fine. 

I need to add logs and a background color to the ScrollView in contentScrollView and chapterContentView. Previous attempts to add the background were partially unsuccessful. I’ll ensure to add .background(reading.backgroundColor) just after the ScrollView. Additionally, I’ll include background color for the preview ScrollView and implement logs and PerfTimer in multiple areas within loadContent and the necessary methods. Let's take care with these edits!
**Ensuring code integrity with LogCategory**

I need to confirm that the additions to the LogCategory enum didn't break any code. The imported os is in DebugUtils, and PerfTimer uses Log.debug, so the Editor compile should be fine. I’ll prepare to apply the patch carefully with the correct context lines.

First, I’ll add the background to contentScrollView by finding the closing bracket for the ScrollView. I can insert .background(reading.backgroundColor) right after the ScrollView and before .scrollIndicators. 

Next, I’ll wrap logs in the loadContent function and implement PerfTimer for the entire load, keeping the indentation without reformatting.
**Inserting logs and performance timers**

I need to add logs where I can, using Log.debug with categories like .reader, .database, and .pagination, along with PerfTimer under .performance. I’ll make sure to instrument ensurePrepared and other functions similarly, such as prefetchAroundCurrent and loadCurrentBook to surround DB reads with PerfTimer.

To start, I’ll modify contentScrollView by inserting .background(reading.backgroundColor) at the boundaries of L244 and L245. Next, I’ll do the same for chapterContentView’s ScrollView by adding the background before the scrollIndicators. After that, I’ll work on instrumenting loadContent, ensuring to implement PerfTimer and logs in various functions, maintaining the necessary escape sequences. Finally, I’ll check the left and right preview views for background application too, then apply the patches one by one.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing updates**

I need to keep going with the implementation. I've added logs and a background color to the central ScrollView. There are still some tasks pending, like working on the instrument_readerview and fixing the ScrollView background. I also want to add a background to the chapter preview scroll views. Additionally, I attempted to implement a PerfTimer around loadCurrentBook, but it didn’t work before, so I'll align the code now. Also, I’ll consider adding performance logs in processParagraphs, which should be minor. User requested using LogCategory for distinction, and I've added those categories.
**Enhancing backgrounds and performance**

I need to ensure that we have a white half screen. It seems that the ScrollView or LazyVStack might default to a white background initially, but I've added a background to the ScrollView. For the preview views, I should also add a background to the chapterContentView's ScrollView, possibly using the existing reading.backgroundColor. I'm considering that the half white and half background might relate to the safe area. The screen size might be zero during the initial onAppear, which could complicate pagination calculations. I also added PerfTimer logs to track major performance tasks and dispatch heavy operations to the background, which is already set up.
**Updating logs and managing tasks**

I should add log categories to many existing Log.debug instances and update some of them. There's the possibility of special prints for onPageAppear, but it’s not necessary. After making edits, I also need to check for any lints. It’s important to follow the tool instructions, so I’ll make sure to mark the instrument_readerview as completed once I wrap up adding logs across various functions. I still need to add a background to chapterContentView, and then I'll mark that task as done too. For commit messages, since the user didn’t include @Commit, there won’t be any commits for now. I also need to implement the additional debug category the user mentioned.
**Implementing patches for reader view**

I need to make sure there are no conflicts after the user added an import manual category along with our existing reader, pagination, prefetch, and performance categories. Next, I’ll implement a patch to add a background to the chapterContentView’s ScrollView and also instrument loadCurrentBook with PerfTimer and relevant categories. I’m considering adding a background to the left/right preview overlays as well since their ScrollView content may default to white. Once patches are in place, I’ll run read_lints, update todos, and mark tasks completed.
**Patching loadCurrentBook function**

I’m looking at the `loadCurrentBook()` function. Right now, it guards against a nil currentBook and ensures the dbQueue is available. I want to add a PerfTimer to measure performance during the database read. To do this, I’ll declare `let t = PerfTimer("loadCurrentBook.dbRead", category: .performance)` and then place `t.end()` after the read. I need to make sure to call `t.end()` even if there’s an exception, but since it’s a try?, exceptions won’t be thrown. Once I apply these changes, I’ll run read_lints on ReaderView.swift and update the todo statuses.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Patching background modifiers**

I’m looking to add a background modifier to the ScrollView and need to address a previous attempt to patch the loading of the current book, which currently lacks the timer. I also have a few TODOs to check off: instrument the ReaderView, mark the scrolling background fix as complete, and apply the background to both contentScrollView and the left/right previews. Lastly, I’m considering the conflict of using 'import' as an enum case in Swift, since it’s a reserved keyword.
**Fixing compilation issues**

The user added 'case import' to the code, which will definitely cause a compilation error. Since they accepted changes, I need to fix this by using backticks, changing it to 'case `import`'. I must respect their adjustments in the code. While we shouldn't necessarily modify logs, fixing the compilation error is essential. I also noticed the need to add log categories where we used Log.debug and consider logging in processParagraphs, but the user's commented log prints are still commented out.
**Adding background and animations**

I’m considering adding animations or a placeholder to prevent a white half-screen issue. This could happen because the ScrollView lacks a background or due to the paginator's heavy CPU load on the first load. I already added performance logs. Another potential cause is the initial screenSize being zero until the geometry is measured. Since we set screenSize in .onAppear, I need to ensure that paginate code uses the right geoSize. We showed a loadingView, but let’s make sure the chapterContentView also has a background to avoid any white areas before we implement the patches.
**Updating TODOs and patches**

I need to ensure I'm following development instructions regarding status updates every time I use tools. I must include a status update before each tool call, as we did previously. My next steps include editing DebugUtils.swift to use backticks, adding backgrounds to the chapterContentView ScrollView in ReaderView.swift, and instrumenting loadCurrentBook with PerfTimer. Once I run lint checks on both files, I can mark those TODOs as completed. I can run these patches in parallel, even if it’s technically in a sequential manner using the apply_patch function.
**Running patches and lint checks**

I’m considering that using apply_patch might be heavy, so I’ll opt to run two operations sequentially to reduce risk, even though the instructions suggest doing them in parallel. I can use multi_tool_use.parallel to execute both apply_patch operations simultaneously. It seems I need to specify 'recipient_name' as "functions.apply_patch" for that. After applying the patches, we’ll also run read_lints on both files, and I think I can run those lint checks in parallel too. Time for a quick update!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing Edits to Code**

I need to keep working on the edits, starting by adding a background to the preview ScrollView in chapterContentView. I remember we already added a PerfTimer to loadCurrentBook, but it seems I overlooked it in the current content. So, I really have to wrap the read function in a timer and call t.end(). Additionally, I want to check if we should add a background to ScrollViewReader too since we have that background set up elsewhere. Time to pinpoint the code modifications needed in ReaderView.swift around line 1219!
**Editing with Fallback Tool**

I think I’ll use functions.edit_file as a fallback to specify the snippet I need to replace since apply_patch failed earlier. First, I remember we need to add .background(reading.backgroundColor) to the preview ScrollView in chapterContentView. I need to find the right spot in the existing code where I can insert that line, specifically between the closing brace of ScrollView and the .scrollIndicators line. I’ll make sure to follow the tool’s schema for the edits, ensuring I include the correct Swift comment syntax. Time to get this done!
**Preparing Code Edits**

I have to make sure I include only the lines we want to edit and provide context lines as necessary. The code_edit block should showcase just the precise lines to edit. So, I can include the existing code snippet and then add the new line for .background(reading.backgroundColor) right after the ScrollView implementation.

It looks like I'll need to clarify the old and new code in the edit as the tool expects an exact replacement, and I have to format it correctly with the context markers. Time to finalize this!
**Crafting Code Edits**

I need to propose edits to either an existing file or create a new one. The instructions tell me to specify the target_file first, and the code_edit block should only include the precise lines to modify without any unchanged code. However, I have to indicate context using "// ... existing code ...". 

For this edit, I'll surround the specific region of the ScrollView, then add the .background(reading.backgroundColor). 

Now, my second edit will be adding the PerfTimer to loadCurrentBook. I'll locate the function and ensure everything is set up correctly.
**Updating Functionality and Managing Edits**

I need to add the PerfTimer setup and end lines in the loadCurrentBook function after the guard statements. Plus, I have to ensure we import PerfTimer from DebugUtils, which is in the same module. We previously added a background for the main ScrollView, so that's all set. 

Next, I’ll update the todo list: mark “instrument readerview” and “fix scrollview background” as completed after adding that background to the preview ScrollView. I'll read both DebugUtils.swift and ReaderView.swift for the necessary edits and follow through with the updates!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing performance logs**

I’m digging into the performance logs, especially focusing on the ensurePrepared process. I see that it finishes quickly, with its main times around 73ms, while later times jump to over 350ms. It seems like the total time is long because it includes wait time until completion is called after dispatch to the main thread. This delay might cause perceived freezes in the UI, especially during rendering or layout changes. The initial UI shows incomplete painting, hinting at heavy main-thread activity. I'm curious about where this load is coming from.
**Investigating rendering delays**

I'm examining the rendering of four pages and noticing delays linked to the main thread's event loop scheduling. There are several potential reasons causing this. Using `.onAppear` with NotificationCenter doesn't seem heavy, and the initial `GeometryReader` could be causing a repeated layout issue. The animation settings appear light as well. One area that raises concern is the "touchBookUpdatedAt" function likely writing to the disk synchronously on the main thread, which could create stalls. I need to check the DatabaseManager for this method and its impact on performance.
**Proposing a performance analysis**

I’m analyzing stalls connected to delays in the ensurePrepared completion, likely due to the main thread being busy, perhaps from a costly Color/SwiftUI gradient. However, logs show that the applyMain process only took 1.27ms. It seems the loadContent time of 76ms might include overhead from thread scheduling. Yet, the reported freezes last 1-2 seconds, which is concerning. The ensurePrepared completions show longer times around 354ms and could be causing stutter due to updates. The white half-screen issue might stem from the ScrollView background not being set properly, but it seems we've tackled that.
**Examining first-run freeze causes**

The first-run freeze might be tied to the SQLite schema creation and WAL pragmas in the DatabaseManager during app launch. Even though the logs are focused on the reading path, the first-run event implies that database initialization can be time-consuming. However, if the freeze happens while entering the first chapter, it could suggest that the initial content load and prefetching of the next three chapters are contributing factors. The ensurePrepared time of around 350ms could indicate that the main thread is blocked, likely due to a synchronous database read in `loadCurrentBook()`.
**Analyzing performance issues**

The initial freezes might stem from the synchronous reading in `loadCurrentBook()` running on the main thread. I suspect the delays in `ensurePrepared` are linked to layout changes from `GeometryReader` and `ScrollViewReader`. This can cause significant delays as the UI rebuilds while processing updates. 

**Proposed Solutions:**  
- Debounce geometry size updates before repagination.  
- Move `loadCurrentBook` DB reads off the main thread.  
- Delay prefetch until the first stable size is observed.  
- Reduce initial prefetch radius.  
- Use `@MainActor` for minimal UI tasks.

Overall, the main thread isn’t blocked by DB operations but rather by layout and UI building as sizes change.
**Drafting the analysis**

Key conclusion: The database and pagination are fast, but the delays arise during the main thread/UI phase, particularly during the initial layout and prefetch callback queuing, compounded by size changes causing additional pagination.

The evidence can be drawn from logs referencing specific line times.

To address potential white screens, we resolved the ScrollView background issue and noted changes in the safe area during the first layout that caused half the screen to turn white.

**Optimization Recommendations (Priority):**
1) Move `loadCurrentBook()` to a background thread and write back to the main thread.
2) Delay first-screen prefetch (e.g., 300 ms) or reduce the radius from 3 to 1.
3) Limit concurrently in-flight `ensurePrepared` calls to 1-2 and avoid triggering UI state changes during completion.
4) Debounce `onChange(of: geo.size)` by 200 ms before repaginating.
5) Disable transition animations in `ScrollViewReader` during the first restore.
6) Prevent duplicate prefetch calls by removing `prefetchAroundCurrent()` from `onAppear`.

Next steps include the proposed optimizations if agreed upon.</details></think>

### 结论（关键点）
- 卡顿不在“读取/分页”本身：DB 读取 0.2–2.2ms、分段 0.5–0.8ms、分页 0.09–0.13ms、主线程应用 1.27ms，均非常快。
- 卡顿来自“主线程调度与首屏 UI 阶段”：`ensurePrepared` 的总耗时 73–354ms，但其内部步骤很快，说明主要在等待主线程回调被执行（主线程当下忙于首屏布局/还原/绘制）。
- 首屏尺寸变化导致重复工作：日志显示先用 358x704 分页，随后几百毫秒又出现 358x623 的分页（安全区/导航条稳定后触发），造成额外的预取和分页。
- 白屏一半问题基本归因于首屏绘制前背景未铺满及尺寸切换（已通过为两个 ScrollView 补背景色修复）。

- ensurePrepared 内部快，但总耗时长：
  - 内部：dbRead <1ms、process ~0.5–0.8ms、paginate ~0.1ms
  - 总耗时：73ms、353ms（说明主线程在忙，回调延后）
- 尺寸变化复算：
  - 先 358x704，稍后变为 358x623，触发再次分页/预取

### 建议优化（按优先级）
- 优化主线程压力
  - 取消 `onAppear` 的首次 `prefetchAroundCurrent()`，仅在 `loadContent` 主线程应用后再调用，避免首屏阶段重复预取。
  - 将 `loadCurrentBook()` 改为后台读取，再在主线程回写 `currentBook`（当前同步在主线程读取）。
  - 首屏阶段降低预取强度：初始半径从 3 降到 1，首屏渲染完成 300ms 后再扩至 3。
  - 限流 `ensurePrepared` 的主线程回写：分批合并写入缓存，或限制 in-flight 任务（并发 1–2 个），减少主线程频繁状态刷新。
- 减少尺寸抖动的重复计算
  - 对 `geo.size` 的首帧变化做 150–200ms 的 debounce，再进行预取/分页；或首帧先用近似高度，稳定后再重算。
- 其他微优化
  - 首次恢复滚动（`scrollToPage`）已设成无动画，保持不动即可，避免额外布局。
  - 保持 ScrollView 背景铺满（已修复）。

### 建议的下一步实现
- 移除 `onAppear` 中的 `prefetchAroundCurrent()`，仅保留 `loadContent` 应用后那一次。
- 将 `loadCurrentBook()` 改为后台读取＋主线程回写。
- 将首次预取半径设为 1，并在首帧渲染 300ms 后扩大到 3。
- 为 `ensurePrepared` 增加一个简单的并发闸（例如串行队列或信号量限制 1–2），以及对多章结果的主线程批量写入。

如果你愿意，我可以直接为上述 4 点提交具体代码编辑，并再补一组性能日志验证优化效果。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering concurrency in SwiftUI**

I'm thinking about concurrency across views and whether it's necessary. I guess I could define a prefetch queue as a constant property instead of making it part of the state. SwiftUI view properties need to be static or computed, but I can define a ‘private let’ in a view without issues.

I'll create a prefetch limiter as a semaphore for controlling access. Then, in the ensurePrepared function, I can try to acquire the semaphore non-blocking, which should streamline my prefetch calls. I'll also focus on limiting concurrency for specific operations.
**Streamlining prefetch tasks**

I'm considering how to combine multiple results but realize it's complex. A simpler approach might be to limit the number of ensurePrepared tasks to just one at a time using a semaphore. I can implement prefetchLimiter.wait() and trigger the background task when the semaphore signals.

However, ensurePrepared is called from the main thread, and placing a blocking wait could hinder the UI responsiveness. If the semaphore value is already available, the wait will be quick, but if prefetch is running, it could delay additional requests from the UI, which isn't ideal.
**Implementing non-blocking prefetch**

I need to set up a non-blocking method for prefetch calls, especially for critical ones. My approach is to add a parameter, isCritical, defaulting to false. For regular prefetch calls, I'll pass false, but for navigation in ensurePrepared, I'll pass true to skip the limiter if it's critical. This way, I reduce the concurrent prefetch tasks to one.

I'll adjust the ensurePrepared function to include isCritical and add a semaphore to control access. If the call times out when acquiring the semaphore, it'll log a message and schedule more tasks for the next tick. After the async completion, I'll signal the semaphore for non-critical tasks.
**Optimizing prefetch and loading**

I need to ensure that the signal for the semaphore is called only after the wait is successful. I'll set up a boolean variable, acquired, to track whether the wait was successful.

Additionally, I'm planning to remove the prefetch call on appearance and debounce size changes before recalculating pages. For loading the current book, I'll switch to using DispatchQueue.global with user-invoked quality for asynchronous execution, improving performance with PerfTimer measures. I'll also pre-initialize the prefetch radius to 1, then, after loading, use a delay to expand it to 3 and call prefetchAroundCurrent() again, ensuring this only happens once.
**Updating prefetch and loading logic**

I'm planning to change the prefetchRadius property from a constant to a state variable, making it initially equal to 1. I also want to remove the prefetchAroundCurrent call on appearance to reduce main thread workload. 

Next, I’ll create a list of new todos, focusing on limiting prefetch concurrency and offloading the loadCurrentBook function to the background. I'll ensure to implement changes in ReaderView.swift, adjusting the ensurePrepared function to include an isCritical parameter. 

Also, I want to log when the prefetch is skipped due to the limiter, and I’ll make sure all relevant properties and imports are included.</details></think>

我将创建待办并开始实现优化：限制预取并发、推迟扩大预取半径、后台读取书籍信息、移除 onAppear 的预取调用，然后编辑 ReaderView.swift 实现这些更改，并在各调用点传递 isCritical 参数。接着我会检查 lints。

## Todo List

- [-] 移除 onAppear 中首次预取调用，减轻主线程
- [ ] 将 loadCurrentBook 后台读取并主线程回写
- [ ] 将预取半径初始为1，首帧后扩至3并二次预取
- [ ] 为 ensurePrepared 添加并发限制与 isCritical 开关

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Editing code functions**

I need to focus on code edits, like removing the onAppear prefetchAroundCurrent call, making loadCurrentBook run on a background thread, and adjusting the prefetch radius. I should establish a concurrency limit for ensurePrepared and the isCritical flag. I’ve seen that apply_patch sometimes succeeds but has failed a few times; since we had errors, the instruction suggests using edit_file as a fallback. Following the TODO status updates will be vital as we progress!
**Updating ReaderView**

I’m looking back at ReaderView.swift and noting that the current prefetchRadius is set statically to 3. I want to make it dynamic, potentially using @State to set it to 1 initially and updating it to 3 after the UI settles. I’ll also remove prefetchAroundCurrent() from onAppear but keep it in loadContent. Adding a concurrency limit for ensurePrepared is crucial, so I might use a DispatchSemaphore or a small helper in ReaderView for managing concurrent tasks effectively with an OperationQueue.
**Implementing concurrency controls**

In the ReaderView, I recognize that the static variable will be shared across instances, and that's okay. I'll create a private static DispatchSemaphore with a value of 2 for managing concurrency in ensurePrepared. It's important to attempt to acquire the semaphore before starting background work, and I need to ensure it signals appropriately on the main thread afterwards. 

I'll also make sure to guard against releasing on all paths, especially early returns and nil checks. Plus, I'll add an optional isCritical parameter to allow flexibility with semaphore usage, responding to the user’s request about concurrency limits!
**Modifying concurrency limits**

I’m considering the isCritical parameter, which will let us decide whether to limit concurrency. If it’s true, we'll skip the semaphore wait to allow critical operations to proceed without limits. Additionally, I'll be moving loadCurrentBook to the background to avoid blocking the main thread. Right now, it runs synchronously, but I'll shift it using DispatchQueue.global to improve performance. 

Finally, I plan to remove prefetchAroundCurrent from onAppear because we want to streamline the code while keeping the necessary calls to restore and touch!
**Implementing prefetch and performance measures**

To start, I'll change `private let prefetchRadius: Int = 3` to `@State private var prefetchRadius: Int = 1` so I can adjust it after the first frame. After loadContent, I’ll schedule a delayed prefetch to increase the radius. I’ll add a DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter block to change prefetchRadius to 3 after a 300ms delay. 

I’ll ensure we haven’t removed prefetch in onAppear and adjust calls to ensurePrepared to mark explicit navigations as critical. It's also a good idea to wrap loadCurrentBook in a background task with a PerfTimer. Finally, I plan to modify the signature of ensurePrepared and then proceed with code edits while maintaining style and indentation.</details></think>

我将开始实现优化：移除首次 onAppear 预取、将 loadCurrentBook 后台读取与主线程回写、将预取半径初始为 1 并在 300ms 后扩至 3 再次预取、为 ensurePrepared 增加并发限制和 isCritical 参数，并更新调用点。随后检查 lints 并勾选已完成的待办。

## Todo List

- [x] 移除 onAppear 中首次预取调用，减轻主线程
- [x] 将 loadCurrentBook 后台读取并主线程回写
- [x] 将预取半径初始为1，首帧后扩至3并二次预取
- [x] 为 ensurePrepared 添加并发限制与 isCritical 开关

---

- 已优化 ReaderView 首次进入的性能路径：
  - 移除 `onAppear` 的立即预取，避免首帧与布局阶段叠加压力
  - `prefetchRadius` 初始为 1，首帧后 300ms 扩至 3 并二次预取
  - `ensurePrepared(for:isCritical:)` 增加并发限制（信号量=2），切章使用 `isCritical=true`，普通预取为 false，降低主线程批量回写争用
  - `loadCurrentBook()` 改为后台读取，主线程仅回写结果
  - 两处 `ScrollView` 已加背景，避免初次白屏

- 建议你再次运行并观察日志：
  - 关注 `ReaderView.onAppear` 总耗时是否下降
  - `ensurePrepared` 总耗时应明显减少（回调更快执行）
  - 首帧阶段日志量应更少，避免重复分页与预取

- 如仍有 1s 左右卡顿，可继续的方向：
  - 将首帧的 `prefetchRadius` 维持 1 更久（600ms-1s）再扩
  - 将 `ensurePrepared` 主线程回写改为批处理（合并多章结果再一次性写入缓存）
  - 增加 `geo.size` 稳定后的 debounce（~150ms）再触发恢复和预取

如果需要，我可以继续把批量回写和 geo.size 的 debounce 也实现上去。

给PerfTimer加个时间戳吧，这样可以知道开始时间和结束时间

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying the PerfTimer structure**

I need to adjust the PerfTimer structure in DebugUtils.swift to add timestamps for start and end times, so logs can reflect this information. The user is noted to be Chinese, so we want to follow the commit message rules regarding language. They didn't use @Commit, so there's no need for auto-commit; we can focus on implementing the code change. Since the task isn't complex, we can skip the todo list. I'll choose to use apply_patch as it's been mostly successful previously, but will check the contents carefully.
**Implementing timestamp formatting**

I can include Date objects for timestamps, either as strings, time intervals since 1970, or formatted in ISO8601. The logger will need to display start and end times in milliseconds since the app started or as UTC. I’ll add startDate: Date in the initializer and compute endDate in the end() method. It’s crucial to avoid heavy overhead, so I should set up a static let dateFormatter for the format and locale, ensuring it's lazily created to maintain simplicity without sacrificing performance. Time to update DebugUtils.swift!
**Implementing timing and formatting**

I’m including both startClock as UInt64 and startMonotonic using DispatchTime.now(). For the output, I’ll provide startStr and endStr. I'll implement the end method to calculate the end date and DispatchTime, with elapsed time computed in nanoseconds. The log message will display the timings in a formatted string. I’ll set up a static DateFormatter for custom formatting, and I'll also consider including a precise timestamp. Finally, I'll ensure to maintain code lints and apply the patch to the file.
**Preparing PerfTimer patch**

I need to add properties for startDate and possibly endDate. First, I'll prepare the patch and run a lint check, then provide a status update and a summary. The current PerfTimer includes properties like name, category, and start time. My changes will add startDate and update the initializer. I’ll also set up a static timeFormatter for date formatting. I’ll ensure that the end method computes elapsed time and prints both start and end times cleanly in the log message. I’ll need to watch out for line widths but won't enforce them.
**Applying the patch**

It’s time to proceed with applying the patch. This is the step where all the changes I've been planning and preparing will be put into action. I'm feeling pretty focused on making sure everything goes smoothly, so I’ll double-check the patch content just to ensure there are no mistakes. Once I apply it, I'll monitor the results to make sure everything has been implemented correctly. Let’s get this done!</details></think>

我将为 PerfTimer 添加开始与结束的时间戳（人类可读 HH:mm:ss.SSS），并保留原有毫秒耗时输出。随后我会检查代码风格与 lint。

- 已为 `PerfTimer` 增加时间戳：现在日志包含开始与结束时间 `[HH:mm:ss.SSS → HH:mm:ss.SSS]`，同时保留耗时毫秒与额外信息。  
- 你可在现有性能日志中直接看到更清晰的时间线关联。
