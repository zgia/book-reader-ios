<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing regex patterns**

I want to find the current structure of my regex capturing groups, specifically to see how group 1 captures numerals and group 2 captures titles. I'll need to keep those intact while making numeral parts optional. To avoid breaking existing code, I should open the relevant file to understand how the pattern is used downstream and check for potential regressions. I'll use functions.read_file to examine the entire file and see if grep can help me locate instances where chapterRegexPattern is utilized.</details></think>

我先查看 `TxtBookImporter.swift` 中该正则的使用方式，确保扩展后的分组不破坏后续逻辑，然后直接更新正则以覆盖这些章节标题形式。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Extending regex for chapter detection**

I need to help extend the regular expression for chapter detection. The user wants to handle various formats like "序", "引子", "前言", and more. The current regex matches "第X章" or "第X回," so I’ll add the additional formats including those without numerals. 

This includes counters like "节" and "话," and I also want to consider forms that have Latin digits, like "第1章." I'll keep the initial anchor and ensure no leading spaces are allowed.
**Refining regex for chapter detection**

I need to refine the regex for match variations of chapters. The current pattern already accounts for "第" followed by digits and certain Chinese characters like [章回]. Now, I want to extend that to include [章回节折话] as well.

There's a question about matching cases like "第十章" without any additional title. The pattern currently doesn't allow for this because it expects at least one non-space character after whitespace. If just "第xx章" is present, I should make the rest of the line optional. This should simplify things and account for various ebook formats.
**Enhancing regex for chapter formats**

I need to refine the regex pattern further to accommodate titles like "序章" with potential suffixes like "一" or lines like "第1节 概述." The current pattern can match "第1节 概述," which is good. 

While titles like "内容简介" might not be typical chapters, the importer uses these to create distinct chapters, so I'll accept them. My pattern also already supports "第xx回", "第xx话", and others. I want to confirm that punctuation like ":" in titles is covered. We should ensure there’s no extra whitespace at the beginning, and while Roman numerals weren’t specifically requested, they might be worth considering.
**Creating a unified regex pattern**

I’m aiming to create a unified regex pattern to match several chapter formats. It will include "第" followed by numerals and the types like 章, 回, 节, 折, or 话.

I also want to capture specific keywords like "序章" and others followed optionally by numbers or symbols. This pattern will start with those keywords or the chapter format.

I need to ensure proper escaping for Swift's NSRegularExpression while keeping the volume detection unchanged. Also, I need to consider edge cases like spaces between "第" and the number and optional phrases like "上/下" capturing correctly.
**Updating regex pattern for chapters**

I’m working on updating the regex pattern for chapter detection and ensuring it supports optional spaces. The new pattern will begin with "第" followed by numerals and specified chapter types, and it will also include specific keywords. 

I’m aiming for the structure to allow for punctuation and optional trailing content. Since the code doesn’t use capturing groups, I want to keep the groups for clarity, and I’ll ensure to escape necessary characters for Swift’s syntax. 

Once I've crafted the new multiline string for the pattern, I'll replace the old one while maintaining the required formatting. Lastly, I’ll generate a commit message in Chinese as required.
**Preparing for code update and commit**

I need to make sure to run diagnostics for the file we've edited, possibly using the `read_lints` function, although I'm unsure if a linter configuration is required. After that, I'll provide a status update and propose a commit message. 

Since we modified the code, I should display the changed lines using markdown code references, showing the relevant code block. I’ll compute the exact updated line numbers for clarity, then draft the appropriate patch to implement the changes using `functions.apply_patch`.</details></think>

我将更新 `BookReader/Data/TxtBookImporter.swift` 中的 `chapterRegexPattern`，以支持更多章节标题形式（如“序”“楔子”“引子”“序言”“前言”“序章”“正文”“人物设定”“内容简介”“作品相关”“后记”“尾声”“附录”“总结”“完本感言”“完结感言”以及“第xx回/节/折/话”），并放宽标题为可选以匹配仅有计数词的行。接下来我会直接进行该代码编辑。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying regex handling**

I’m working on how titles are captured. They don't use capture groups, just match the chapter lines directly, which is fine for compatibility. It's crucial to ensure the line starts with an anchor. I'm considering if I should add support for Chinese numeral variants like 贰叁 or 廿卅, though it’s not strictly necessary. I should also remember to include spacing rules between "第" and numbers. Lastly, I confirmed that edge cases won't inadvertently match "卷."
**Updating regex for titles**

I changed the regex to allow optional trailing groups instead of requiring trailing title content, which previously needed a non-whitespace character followed by anything else. Now, even lines like "序" will match, which is exactly what I want. It's exciting to see this improvement in flexibility! Next, I should run the `read_lints` function to check for any issues or further refinements needed. This feels like a productive step forward!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating regex patterns**

I need to update regex patterns to include more matches based on the user's requests. They previously confirmed wanting to add aliases like 目录, 彩蛋, and 特别篇, and now they want to add "番外" as well. 

Currently, the volumeRegexPattern only matches "第xx卷 <title>," but they want volume names to include "番外" too. I need to interpret that "卷名可能还包括“番外”" means it could be standalone or with a suffix. 

So, I'll modify both the volumeRegexPattern and chapterRegexPattern to accommodate these changes.
**Considering todo requirements**

I see that I need to use the todo_write tool for multi-step tasks, but this is a minor code edit involving just two lines. The spec allows skipping the todo list for straightforward tasks, but it seems I should create one for medium to large tasks.

However, since this seems simple enough, I'll skip the todos for now and just use apply_patch to edit. I'll ensure the file indentation remains at four spaces and correctly edit both volumeRegexPattern and chapterRegexPattern, adding the desired matches for "番外", "番外篇", and "番外卷."
**Modifying regex patterns**

I'm adding an alternative pattern for volumeRegex that captures optional titles after the main title. This new pattern will include both "第...卷" and "番外" with any suffixes. I’ll keep the existing capture groups since they’re only used for matching and don’t interfere elsewhere.

For chapterRegexPattern, I've adjusted it to accommodate more aliases, like "目录." The user specifically requested to include "番外xxx" for chapter titles, meaning titles that start with "番外" followed by anything. I’ll implement these changes!
**Incorporating special keywords**

I’m integrating "番外" into the list of special keywords. The user has specifically asked for "番外xxx," and my current pattern already captures optional trailing content after any keyword, so that works perfectly. 

It’s good that I can match various formats, including "第x章 番外" and typical forms like "番外1" or "番外·角色篇." Earlier, I added other keywords like "彩蛋|彩蛋篇|特别篇," plus "第xx回/节/折/话." 

Now, for volumeRegex, I'll include "番外" and allow for forms like "番外篇" or "番外卷." I'll implement these requested adjustments!
**Addressing regex edge cases**

I need to consider edge cases since the update to volumeRegex now allows for optional trailing titles. If the line only contains "番外," that becomes the volume title, which is good! I’ll update the patterns while making sure to preserve any necessary escaping in Swift strings.

Also, the hyphen in my character class for separators needs attention; it should be placed correctly to avoid range semantics. I’ll check the current state of volumeRegexPattern and chapterRegexPattern in the file before modifying anything, and I’ll avoid conflicting changes. Overall, I need to read the file again before applying any patches!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying regex patterns**

I'm looking to support "番外" in volume and chapter names, as the user requested. They want to modify the patterns for recognizing volumes and chapters. Currently, the volumeRegexPattern focuses on something like "第xx卷," but now I need to account for "番外" as a valid volume label too.

There are two ways to interpret the user's request: either “番外” is a volume itself or part of a title. Typically, "番外" is used for chapters, so I need to adapt the regex to accept both interpretations.
**Updating regex patterns**

I'm examining how the code uses volumeRegex with Self.matches, which doesn't capture groups since it determines a new volume and sets the volume title as the whole trimmed line. The specifics of the groups aren't crucial, so I can update them freely.

Next, for chapterRegexPattern, it currently accommodates special forms and enumerated words. Now, I need to include "番外xxx" as part of special words. The existing pattern already supports optional titles, so adding "番外" will allow for formats like "番外" or "番外 XXX." Additionally, I need to ensure that the pattern accommodates "第x卷 番外" and separate volumes like "番外卷."
**Revising volumeRegex**

I'm considering how the updated volumeRegex will match "番外" as a volume header, which might lead the importer to treat "番外" lines as new volumes and close the current chapter. I'm wondering if this is the intended behavior. 

I could also look into expanding chapter number recognition to include Roman numerals, though that's not specifically requested. It's crucial to maintain the correct indentation style with 4 spaces and proper alignment at 8 for code lines. 

So, I’ll adjust the volumeRegexPattern to accommodate these changes while preserving the existing formatting requirements.
**Updating regex patterns**

I need to make some adjustments to the chapterRegexPattern by including "番外" and "番外篇" in the second alternation. Right now, it already contains "彩蛋," "彩蛋篇," and "特别篇." While I could consider adding "特典" and "外传," that wasn’t specifically requested, so I’ll stick to what's been asked.

The user also wants to ensure "第xx回/节/折/话" is included, which we’ve already addressed. Before applying the patch to update both regex strings, I should provide a brief status update since using tools. A quick 1-2 sentence summary will do the trick! Afterward, I'll run lints on the file path and prepare a commit message.
**Generating commit suggestions**

I see there's a global rule for creating Chinese git commit messages, but the memory states we should only perform a commit when "@Commit" is included. In this case, no such instruction is present, even though the rules suggest generating a commit message. 

Since the user didn't ask to commit, I won't execute that command but can propose a commit message as a suggestion at the end, following the correct format. I’ll also apply the patch to update volumeRegexPattern and chapterRegexPattern, ensuring no escaping issues in Swift strings. After that, I’ll run read_lints and prepare a summary with code references.</details></think>
