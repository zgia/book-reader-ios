<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering project updates**

I need to set `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 26.0` in the project file, but I’m wondering if that’s allowed, especially with Xcode and iOS 26 being hypothetical. I'll update the `project.pbxproj` to ensure this and consider `SWIFT_VERSION` at 6.0, since that might be the latest. I should verify SDK compatibility and privacy strings, even though they weren't requested. They've noted a confirmation about using the latest Swift and SwiftUI guidelines, but the task feels a bit ambiguous about making changes on my own.
**Confirming project compliance**

I should confirm that we understand the need to align any changes with Xcode 26/iOS 26. However, I can't run Xcode in my environment, so I'll provide the necessary steps for setting it up. The workspace rules require a specific Git commit message in Chinese for any changes. But the user hasn’t requested a commit, even though there’s a modified `BookListView.swift`. Since they didn't ask to commit, we shouldn't do that. Maybe I can suggest creating a TODO list instead since the task seems too minor.
**Updating project settings**

I’m looking at a single file edit to `project.pbxproj` across various configuration sections, which could count as multiple changes. It's simple but not trivial. The guidelines suggest creating a TODO list for medium-to-large tasks, but I think changing build settings might not require that since editing one file may qualify as a single step. I need to read the file first to locate `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, and I’ll use `read_file` to open `BookReader.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`. I should also consider updating the Swift version for compatibility with Xcode 26.
**Changing deployment target**

I'll focus on changing the deployment target across both Debug and Release configurations. First, I’ll provide a status update: "我会检查并将部署目标设置为 iOS 26。" Then, I plan to open the `pbxproj` file using `read_file`. I’ll search for `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, and it might be helpful to use grep, too. While the file is large, it's fine to read it entirely if needed. I’m thinking about making parallel tool calls since reading that file is the next step.</details></think>

我先检查并在项目设置中将 iOS 部署目标更新为 26.0，确保在 Xcode 26 上针对 iOS 26 设备构建。接着我会修改 `BookReader.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` 中的相关配置。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting deployment target**

I need to change the deployment target to iOS 26.0 in Xcode 26. Currently, the pbxproj shows different IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET values: project-level Debug and Release at 18.5, and target-level Debug/Release at 18.0. I'll update both to 26.0 and double-check the Info.plist for the minimum OS; although typically only the IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is important. I’ll also check if Swift version 6 is being used, as the user mentioned compiling for iOS 26. This is a small edit, so no need for todos.
**Updating tool call compliance**

I noticed the previous assistant's message didn't fully align with the status_update_spec style, but it still contained an update before the tool call—so that might qualify. Now, I need to edit the pbxproj to update the IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET values to 26.0. I'll also check the Info.plist for any necessary keys for iOS 26, although it might not be required. Additionally, there are workspace rules about commit messages in Chinese, but since the user didn’t include "@Commit," I won't commit automatically.
**Clarifying commit message guidelines**

The workspace rules state that I should generate a compliant Chinese Git commit message, but the instructions are a bit confusing because they mix guidance about commit messages and iOS Swift developer guidelines. It seems like I should only create a commit message when actual changes are made. The user memory indicates that auto-commit only triggers when "@Commit" is used. So while workspace rules usually apply, they seem to conflict with the user's specific instructions regarding commits.
**Proposing commit message without committing**

I can generate a commit message, but I'm not ready to commit yet—perhaps I should propose it instead. The developer instructions mention using editing tools for code changes, so I’ll apply a patch to the pbxproj. We need to update both the target-level and project-level IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET values to 26.0 and remove the older ones. I should provide a precise patch with apply_patch, and although there's no Swift linter, I'll skip that step. Also, I might have to update `SWIFT_VERSION` to 6.0 since they’re using a hypothetical iOS 26.
**Updating deployment target and commit message**

I'm keeping `SWIFT_VERSION` at 5.0 for now since changing the deployment target to 26.0 may affect SPM minimums, but let's assume that's fine. I’ll update `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` values from 18.0 to 26.0 at four specific lines. I also want to propose a status update in Chinese stating, "已更新部署目标为26.0，接下来建议清理构建." 

Since we can't run Xcode build directly, I can suggest using `run_terminal_cmd`. I’ll craft a standard Chinese Git commit message with the necessary changes listed. The user hasn’t included "@Commit," so I’ll propose commands instead of auto-committing, ensuring I follow guidelines about clear communication. Lastly, I should verify if I need to update the `MinimumOSVersion` in `Info.plist`.</details></think>

我将把项目和目标的 `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` 都更新为 26.0，确保能在 iOS 26 设备上构建运行。接着我会应用编辑到 `BookReader.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`。
